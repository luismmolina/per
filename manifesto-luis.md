# The Manifesto of Irreversible Action

*Written for Luis. December 2025.*

## You Already Know

You have spent months calculating. You have modeled scenarios down to the second decimal. You know that 169/229/289 works. You know TikTok gives 10x ROAS. You know individual tacos at 33 pesos can capture the locals walking past your door. You know that sleeping before midnight makes you sharper. You know that Polytopia and Twitter steal hours that compound into years.

**You already know.**

The problem has never been information. It has never been a lack of intelligence—your spreadsheets prove you can out-think most people. The problem is that knowing feels like doing. It does not. Every hour you spend modeling a scenario is an hour you did not spend living inside one.

Your journal is full of sentences that start with "I would like to" and "I am considering." Those words are the language of the bystander. They are the vocabulary of someone watching their own life from a distance, narrating possibilities instead of creating facts.

## The Trap You Built

You have constructed a prison of optionality. You keep every door open because closing one feels like loss. But here is the truth you have been avoiding: **keeping all doors open means walking through none of them.**

You tell yourself you are being prudent. You tell yourself you need more data. But prudence does not analyze the same decision seventeen times. That is not prudence—that is paralysis wearing a sophisticated mask.

You are afraid. Say it. You are afraid that if you raise prices, customers will leave. You are afraid that if you commit to Costa Coral, you will lose the dream of software. You are afraid that if you try and fail visibly, it will confirm something you secretly suspect about yourself.

But look at your notes. Look at what you wrote in September: *"Your core failure mode is irreversibility avoidance."* You saw the diagnosis. You wrote it down. Then you continued avoiding.

This is the cruelest pattern: **recognizing a trap and staying in it anyway.**

## What You Are Actually Choosing

Every day you do not implement the price increase, you choose anxiety over discomfort. The anxiety is chronic, low-grade, endless. The discomfort of action is acute, temporary, and educational. You are choosing the worse option daily and pretending it is the safer one.

Every night you stay up until 1 AM "working," you choose the illusion of productivity over actual rest. You wake up tired, rush to Costa Coral, operate at 60% capacity, come home exhausted, and repeat. You are not grinding—you are grinding yourself into dust for diminishing returns.

Every project you start and abandon teaches you one lesson: **you cannot follow through.** Each incomplete attempt reinforces the story that you are someone who plans but does not build. And you are writing that story yourself, one abandoned folder at a time.

## The Only Math That Matters

You have 168 hours per week. About 56 of those go to sleep—or should. You spend roughly 60 hours at the restaurant or commuting. That leaves 52 hours.

What are you doing with 52 hours?

You check Twitter. You scroll memes. You model another scenario that produces no outcome. You start an app you will not finish. You lie in bed with your phone for 45 minutes after waking. You stay up late feeling busy while accomplishing nothing permanent.

Fifty-two hours. That is enough time to film 20 TikToks per week. It is enough time to build a real application, from scratch, in a month. It is enough time to design a new menu, visit three competitor restaurants, write 10 ad scripts, call 15 restaurant owners and pitch them your video service.

But you will not do any of that if you continue treating your hours like they are infinite. They are not. You are 42. You have maybe 40 productive years left if you are lucky. That is approximately 2,000 weeks. You have spent the last 20 of those weeks doing the same analysis in different arrangements.

## What Must Die

The following beliefs must die today:

**"I need more information."** — No. You have modeled Costa Coral's margins to three decimal places. You are not information-poor. You are commitment-poor.

**"I should wait for the right moment."** — The right moment is a myth. There is only this moment, and then the next, and eventually none. December will not feel better than November. February will feel worse.

**"If I fail, I will have wasted months."** — You are wasting months *right now* by not failing. Failure teaches in weeks what deliberation cannot teach in years.

**"I can do both."** — No. You must choose: Costa Coral until it is profitable, or abandon it entirely. The B2B service, the apps, the AI experiments—they will wait, or you will build them properly when you have the financial margin to focus. Doing three things at 30% produces zero outcomes.

## The New Operating System

From today, you will run on different rules:

1. **One irreversible action before noon.** Every day. Before you check your phone, before you open Twitter, before you scroll anything—one action that cannot be undone. Send the message. Post the video. Print the new menu. Call the person.

2. **No scenario survives 24 hours in your head.** If you catch yourself modeling the same idea twice, you execute or discard it immediately. The second analysis is procrastination in disguise.

3. **Sleep at 10:30 PM.** Not because it is healthy—because every hour after 10 PM is where you lie to yourself about being productive while producing nothing.

4. **One project until January.** Costa Coral. Only Costa Coral. The software dreams go into a folder called "2025-PAUSE." You will open it on January 1st if and only if Costa Coral is generating 30k+ profit per month.

5. **Record discomfort, not plans.** When you journal, do not write "I would like to." Write "I am scared to" and then explain why. That is the real work.

## The Man You Are Becoming

Imagine Luis in one year. Costa Coral runs profitably with minimal staff. TikTok brings consistent traffic. Individual tacos fill the weekday gaps. Your rent is covered. You have 25 free hours per week because you optimized the operation instead of just surviving it.

That Luis exists if this Luis stops asking permission. If this Luis stops simulating and starts acting. If this Luis accepts that comfort is not safety, and that perfectionism is just fear pretending to be excellence.

You have one life. You are spending it inside spreadsheets.

Go print the menu.
