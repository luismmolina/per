# Contextual Assistant

A smart journal app that combines note-taking with AI-powered insights. Built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript.

## Features

- **Unified Conversation View**: Everything happens in one timeline - your notes and AI responses
- **Two-Action Interface**: Simply type and choose to either "Add Note" or "Ask AI"
- **Smart Context**: AI receives only your notes (not questions) as context for intelligent responses
- **Production Cost Integration**: Automatically fetches and includes current production cost data from your API
- **Profit Opportunity Finder**: Click the lens icon to discover the highest-probability opportunity to increase profits
- **Conversation Management**: Delete individual notes, prune conversations and download notes with timestamps
- **Persistent Storage**: Your conversations are automatically saved and restored between sessions
- **Clean, Modern UI**: Chat-like interface with distinct styling for notes vs AI responses
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- **Code Execution**: AI can run Python code for precise mathematical calculations
- **First Principles Thinking**: Enhanced AI prompts for rigorous business analysis

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your Gemini API key and Postgres `DATABASE_URL`.

2. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

4. **If you can't connect to Gemini:**

   - Call [http://localhost:3000/api/debug](http://localhost:3000/api/debug) to verify your environment
   - You may need a new API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)

## How to Use

1. **Adding Notes**: Type your thoughts, ideas, or information and click "Add Note" to save them to your knowledge base
2. **Asking Questions**: Type a question and click "Ask AI" to get contextual responses based on all your previous notes
3. **Find Profit Opportunity**: Click the lens icon (üîç) to get the most promising way to increase profits
4. **Managing Conversations**: Use the trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) to delete a note, the scissors icon (‚úÇÔ∏è) to clean up conversations, and the download icon (üì•) to export notes
5. **Smart Context**: Only your notes (not questions or AI responses) are sent to the AI as context

## Message Types & Context

**üü¢ Notes (Green)** - Knowledge/facts that ARE sent to AI:

- "I work at TechCorp as a software engineer"
- "My favorite programming language is Python"
- "I'm learning React and Next.js"

**üîµ Questions (Blue)** - Queries that are NOT sent to AI:

- "What do I do for work?"
- "What are my favorite technologies?"
- "Help me plan my learning path"

**‚ö™ AI Responses (White)** - Responses that are NOT sent to AI:

- AI answers and error messages

**Why this matters:** This prevents questions from polluting your knowledge base and ensures the AI only receives relevant context.

## Production Cost Integration

The app automatically fetches current production cost data from your API endpoint (`https://cogs-two.vercel.app/api/dishes/prices`) and includes it in the context sent to the AI. This enables:

- **Real-time cost analysis** - AI can analyze current production costs and cost structures
- **Profit margin calculations** - Precise calculations using actual production costs
- **Cost optimization insights** - Identify high-cost items and optimization opportunities
- **Pricing strategy recommendations** - Data-driven recommendations based on production costs

The production cost data includes:

- Dish names and production costs
- Last updated timestamps
- Total number of dishes in production
- Currency information (MXN)
- **Detailed cost breakdowns** - Calculation notes showing ingredient-by-ingredient cost analysis

**Example usage:**

- "What's the average production cost of my dishes?"
- "Which dishes have the highest production costs?"
- "How much would it cost to produce 10 of each dish?"
- "What's the total production cost for my current menu?"
- "Which dishes should I consider for cost optimization?"
- "Show me the detailed cost breakdown for Pasta al mojo de ajo"
- "Which ingredients contribute most to the cost of Taco Costa Coral?"
- "Analyze the yield percentages in my cost calculations"

## Enhanced AI Capabilities

### First Principles Thinking
The AI uses enhanced prompts that encourage:
- **Rigorous analytical methods** with practical business insights
- **First principles thinking** to break down complex problems
- **Physics principles** (thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, optimization) when applicable
- **Bayesian statistics** for uncertainty quantification
- **Mathematical precision** - business decisions often hinge on 1% differences

### Code Execution
- **Python code execution** for all mathematical calculations
- **Precise financial calculations** with proper rounding
- **Confidence intervals** and uncertainty estimates
- **Step-by-step calculations** shown in code blocks

### Profit Opportunity Finder
Click the lens icon to get AI-powered insights on:
- The single opportunity most likely to increase profits
- A short explanation of why it has a high chance of success

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React useState (local state)
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro with enhanced prompts

## API Configuration

The app uses Google's Gemini AI API. **If you're experiencing connection issues:**

1. **Run diagnostics**: Visit `/api/debug` in your browser to verify environment variables
2. **Check your API key**: If diagnostics fail with "API key not valid", you need a new key
3. **Get a new API key**: Go to [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) ‚Üí "Get API Key" ‚Üí "Create API Key"
4. **Configure environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the required keys

For production use, keep your keys only in environment variables, never in source code.

## Data Storage

- **Primary Storage**: Neon Postgres (via `@neondatabase/serverless`)
- **Data Shape**: Stored as a single JSON document keyed by `contextual-conversations`
- **Auto-Save**: Every message is automatically saved via API calls
- **Cloud Persistence**: Your conversations are stored securely in Postgres

### Environment Setup

Add these environment variables to your `.env.local` (values shown are examples):
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DB?sslmode=require
# Optional alternates if you use them elsewhere
DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=...
PGHOST=...
PGUSER=...
PGDATABASE=...
PGPASSWORD=...
```

Install the Postgres client:
```
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

## Development

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Create production build
- `npm run start` - Start production server
