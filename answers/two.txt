**3. Methodology**
1.  **Calculate Total Revenue (`R_aug`):** Sum the daily sales figures provided for August 2025.
2.  **Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (`COGS`):**
    *   `C_food`: Sum all invoice amounts from Granados and Rey Camaron for August.
    *   `C_tortillas`: Calculate the total monthly cost by determining the total kilograms used for both handmade and machine-made tortillas based on the number of weekdays (17) and weekend days (10) in August, then multiply by their respective costs per kilogram.
        *   `Handmade kg` = (17 days * 4 kg/day) + (10 days * 7 kg/day)
        *   `Machine-made kg`: Usage is described weekly. We will scale the weekly usage by the number of weeks in the month (31 days / 7 days/week). `Weekly machine kg` = 4 kg (weekday) + 4 kg (weekend) = 8 kg. `Total machine kg` = 8 kg/week * (31/7) weeks.
    *   `C_agua_pulp`: Calculate the total liters of pulp used based on the number of weekdays and weekend days, and multiply by the cost per liter. `Liters` = (17 days * 0.5 L/day) + (10 days * 1 L/day).
    *   `COGS` = `C_food` + `C_tortillas` + `C_agua_pulp`.
3.  **Calculate Total Operating Expenses (`E_operating`):**
    *   `E_fixed`: Sum the monthly costs for Rent, Electricity, Water, Internet, Accountant, and Advertising.
    *   `E_wages`: Calculate the total weekly wage bill (5,850 MXN) and multiply by the number of weeks in August (31 days / 7 days).
    *   `E_gas`: Sum the Gas LP purchases made during August.
    *   `E_cleaning`: Sum the monthly estimated costs for all cleaning supplies.
    *   `E_operating` = `E_fixed` + `E_wages` + `E_gas` + `E_cleaning`.
4.  **Calculate Profit or Loss (`P_L`):**
    *   The final profit or loss will be calculated using the formula: `P_L = R_aug - COGS - E_operating`.

**Assumptions:**
*   The provided supplier invoices for August represent the total food cost for the month.
*   Gas LP purchases made in August are a reasonable proxy for the gas consumed.
*   The baseline advertising budget is the most accurate figure for August's advertising expense.
*   Fixed expenses, wages, and consumption patterns for tortillas and agua fresca pulp are consistent as per the provided data.
