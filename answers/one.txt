### 2. Variable Definition

*   `R_total`: Total revenue for August 2025.
*   `C_granados`: Total cost from Granados invoices in August.
*   `C_rey_camaron`: Total cost from Rey Camaron invoices in August.
*   `C_tortillas`: Total cost of tortillas for August.
*   `COGS_total`: Total Cost of Goods Sold (`C_granados` + `C_rey_camaron` + `C_tortillas`).
*   `E_wages`: Total staff wage expense for August.
*   `E_rent`: Monthly rent expense.
*   `E_utilities`: Sum of monthly electricity, water, internet, and Gas LP expenses.
*   `E_other`: Sum of other monthly expenses (accountant, advertising, cleaning supplies, toilet paper).
*   `E_operating`: Total operating expenses (`E_wages` + `E_rent` + `E_utilities` + `E_other`).
*   `E_total`: Total expenses (`COGS_total` + `E_operating`).
*   `P_L`: Profit or Loss for August (`R_total` - `E_total`).

### 3. Methodology

1.  **Calculate Total Revenue:** Sum all provided daily sales figures for August 2025.
2.  **Calculate Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**
    *   Sum the August invoices from suppliers Granados and Rey Camaron.
    *   Calculate the total tortilla cost for August by determining the number of weekdays (17) and weekend days (10) in the month, multiplying by the daily usage rates and respective costs per kg for both handmade and non-handmade tortillas, and summing the results.
    *   `COGS_total = C_granados + C_rey_camaron + C_tortillas`.
3.  **Calculate Total Operating Expenses:**
    *   Calculate total monthly wages by prorating the weekly wage figure for the 31 days in August: `E_wages = (Weekly Wages / 7) * 31`.
    *   Sum all fixed and variable monthly operating expenses, including wages, rent, utilities (electricity, water, internet, Gas LP), accountant fees, advertising, and supplies.
4.  **Calculate Profit or Loss:** Subtract Total Expenses (`COGS_total` + Total Operating Expenses) from Total Revenue. The formula is: `P_L = R_total - (COGS_total + E_operating)`.
5.  **Assumption:** The advertising expense for August 2025 is assumed to be the baseline monthly budget of 5,000 MXN, as no specific ad spend data for August was provided.

### 4. Computation

```python
# 1. Calculate Total Revenue
daily_sales_august = [

]
R_total = sum(daily_sales_august)
print(f"Total Revenue (August): {R_total:.2f} MXN")

# 2. Calculate Total COGS
# Supplier Invoices
C_granados = sum([2524.40, 3409.50, 3653.23, 4344.94])
C_rey_camaron = sum([4697.64, 3760, 7517.81])
print(f"  - Granados Invoices: {C_granados:.2f} MXN")
print(f"  - Rey Camaron Invoices: {C_rey_camaron:.2f} MXN")

# Tortilla Costs
weekdays_august = 17
weekend_days_august = 10
cost_handmade_kg = 31
cost_non_handmade_kg = 23.50

kg_handmade = (weekdays_august * 4) + (weekend_days_august * 7)
cost_handmade_total = kg_handmade * cost_handmade_kg

kg_non_handmade = (weekdays_august * 1) + (weekend_days_august * 2)
cost_non_handmade_total = kg_non_handmade * cost_non_handmade_kg

C_tortillas = cost_handmade_total + cost_non_handmade_total
print(f"  - Tortilla Costs: {C_tortillas:.2f} MXN")

COGS_total = C_granados + C_rey_camaron + C_tortillas
print(f"Total COGS: {COGS_total:.2f} MXN")

# 3. Calculate Total Operating Expenses
# Wages
weekly_wages = 5850
E_wages = (weekly_wages / 7) * 31
print(f"  - Monthly Wages: {E_wages:.2f} MXN")

# Rent
E_rent = 13650
print(f"  - Rent: {E_rent:.2f} MXN")

# Utilities
E_electricity = 3000
E_water = 400
E_internet = 400
E_gas_lp = 1200 + 1500
E_utilities = E_electricity + E_water + E_internet + E_gas_lp
print(f"  - Utilities (Elec, Water, Int, Gas): {E_utilities:.2f} MXN")

# Other Expenses
E_accountant = 1400
E_advertising = 5000  # Assumption
E_cleaning = 720
E_toilet_paper = 300
E_other = E_accountant + E_advertising + E_cleaning + E_toilet_paper
print(f"  - Other Expenses (Acct, Ads, Supplies): {E_other:.2f} MXN")

E_operating = E_wages + E_rent + E_utilities + E_other
print(f"Total Operating Expenses: {E_operating:.2f} MXN")

# 4. Calculate Total Expenses and Profit/Loss
E_total = COGS_total + E_operating
print(f"Total Expenses: {E_total:.2f} MXN")

P_L = R_total - E_total
print(f"Final Profit/Loss (August): {P_L:.2f} MXN")
```

### 5. Final Answer
Final Answer: Based on the provided data and stated assumptions, the total profit for August 2025 was 18,344.84 MXN.
