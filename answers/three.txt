### 3. Methodology

The profit or loss for August 2025 will be calculated by subtracting the Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Total Operating Expenses (OpEx) from the Total Revenue.

1.  **Total Revenue Calculation:**
    *   `total_revenue` = Sum of all `venta` values from the daily sales log for August 2025.

2.  **Total COGS Calculation:**
    *   `cogs_granados` = Sum of August invoice amounts.
    *   `cogs_rey_camaron` = Sum of August invoice amounts.
    *   `cogs_tortillas` = (`cost_handmade`) + (`cost_machine_made`)
        *   `cost_handmade` = ((17 weekdays × 4 kg/day) + (10 weekend days × 7 kg/day)) × 25 MXN/kg
        *   `cost_machine_made` = (4.4286 weeks × (4 kg/week_weekday + 4 kg/week_weekend)) × 23.50 MXN/kg
    *   `cogs_agua_fresca` = ((17 weekdays × 0.5 L/day) + (10 weekend days × 1 L/day)) × 135 MXN/L
    *   `total_cogs` = `cogs_granados` + `cogs_rey_camaron` + `cogs_tortillas` + `cogs_agua_fresca`

3.  **Total OpEx Calculation:**
    *   `op_ex_wages` = (2400 + 2050 + 700 + 700) MXN/week × (31 days / 7 days/week)
    *   `op_ex_utilities` = `Electricity` + `Water` + `Internet`
    *   `op_ex_gas` = (`Avg. daily consumption %` × 31 days) × `Avg. cost per %`
        *   The average daily consumption (1.9%/day) and average cost per percentage point (31.36 MXN/%) are derived from five separate Gas LP purchase records from June to August 2025.
    *   `op_ex_supplies` = `Desengrasante` + `Limpiapisos` + `Cloro` + `Papel secante` + `Toilet Paper`
    *   `total_op_ex` = `op_ex_wages` + `op_ex_rent` + `op_ex_utilities` + `op_ex_gas` + `op_ex_advertising` + `op_ex_accountant` + `op_ex_supplies`

4.  **Final Profit/Loss Calculation:**
    *   `net_profit_loss` = `total_revenue` - `total_cogs` - `total_op_ex`

**Assumptions:**
*   The price for handmade tortillas in August 2025 was 25 MXN/kg, the rate effective prior to the price change mentioned on September 3, 2025.
*   Gas LP consumption is calculated using an average daily rate derived from historical purchase data due to the irregular purchase schedule.
*   The advertising expense for August 2025 is assumed to be the baseline monthly budget of 5,000 MXN, as a specific total for the month was not provided.
*   The consumption pattern for machine-made tortillas is based on a weekly rate (4 kg for the weekday block and 4 kg for the weekend block per week).
