==================================================

[9/7/25, 6:19 AM] i need to sleep early, I think i can do more, feel more productive, and enjoy my day better if I wake up early, lets say around five am

[9/7/25, 6:20 AM] I lately have been drinking around 2 cans of beer per day

[9/7/25, 6:26 AM] I want to build apps with AI for a living. I'm tired of working on the restaurant and being worried all the time about money

[9/7/25, 6:30 AM] Worried about money. Today we sold very little in the restaurant. Don't know how we will do it next week

[9/7/25, 6:53 AM] I have only a few pieces of clothes

[9/7/25, 6:53 AM] My wife's name is Diana Montoya Magaña

[9/7/25, 6:53 AM] I was born in 1982 March 27

[9/7/25, 6:54 AM] I am a male, born in Mexico

[9/7/25, 6:54 AM] My name is Luis

[9/7/25, 6:54 AM] I'm stressed mostly about money right now

[9/7/25, 6:55 AM] I notice that if I go to bed before 12am I rest better and wakeup early more easily

[9/7/25, 6:58 AM] I like dogs

[9/7/25, 6:59 AM] While I should spend more time with my family, I don't interact with them as much as I should

[9/7/25, 7:16 AM] I need to sleep, currently I am not getting too much by staying up late

[9/7/25, 7:42 AM] I would like to wake up early, but being here trying to make an application made it take me longer. Right now I'm going to go to bed and try to sleep.

[9/7/25, 7:46 AM] I am very interested in making applications with artificial intelligence.

[9/7/25, 7:48 AM] My mind is confused. Today we sold very little in the restaurant. Well, not today. Yesterday was Saturday. Today is dawn, so there are no sales yet. Now I have to go to sleep. In reality there is not much to do, what was done was already done in the week. Now that's what to wait, I hope it sells well by tomorrow, Sunday. Maybe what I can do is increase the ad budget and create an ad in the morning as soon as possible. and wait for the best.

[9/7/25, 6:13 PM] Today, Sunday, I plan to eat with Diana some smoked patties. It's 12 o'clock, or 11 o'clock, and it's still very hot.

[9/7/25, 11:21 PM] Right now I'm sitting in the middle of Tulio and Citlaly and we are talking about web sites and artificial intelligence.

[9/8/25, 5:08 AM] Think on trying to go to bed at 9 pm. To work on 2 of my digital projects. The one about the university directories and the one about making videos for restaurants for social media. Work tirelessly for at least 2 weeks on this two projects

[9/8/25, 5:10 AM] I drink around 4 beers today

[9/8/25, 5:11 AM] Today I talked with Citlali, Tulio, Ana and Enrique.

[9/8/25, 5:12 AM] Citlalli has good analogies about problems in life. She is good at it

[9/8/25, 5:12 AM] Ana can be an amazing friend, I wonder what I need to make a deeper connection with her

[9/8/25, 6:17 AM] Still I haven't went to bed.

[9/8/25, 6:18 AM] I'm worried about money, but thinking on building something (software) and sell it. Don't know if excited, but decided

[9/8/25, 6:33 AM] I want a easier job to do. Mainly on the computer with more time for me and my family. Currently I only rest one day on the week and usually end up doing things for the restaurant. I want to do things with AI and a computer.

[9/8/25, 6:33 AM] I need to remind myself that I need to drink more water. A lot more, currently I almost don't drink water

[9/8/25, 6:34 AM] I need to reduce my consumption of sugar

[9/8/25, 6:35 AM] I wonder how much money do I need per month to feel not worries about it. Maybe another 15,000 mxn per month

[9/8/25, 2:11 PM] I wake up at 6.20 in the morning, however I haven't done much, I've been on the cell phone, on Twitter, and so far I haven't done much either. I'm still on the internet. Well, even if I prepare a little coffee, it's about 8 or 10. I would like to have a plan of what I would like to do, and even if I only did 40 minutes a day in the mornings, I think it would be a great progress, especially in things like doing something productive, a project maybe, etc.

[9/8/25, 2:12 PM] I realize that I'm wasting time on things that leave me absolutely nothing for the future. For example, watching memes on the internet.

[9/8/25, 2:13 PM] I will start with a list of things that I would like to complete in a week and I will choose the minimum next step that can move that maybe something of 5 or 10 minutes and we will see what happens.

[9/8/25, 2:18 PM] I continue distracted, in this case with Twitter. As I'm looking for the correct platform indicated to make the list of tasks that I would like to do, but I realized that even a text document would solve it. possibly it is just a way to avoid what I really have to do.

[9/8/25, 4:30 PM] I just made two Facebook ads for the Costa Coral restaurant. They are very basic, but it is better than nothing. I made an advance, at least.

[9/8/25, 5:25 PM] I'm going to work, it's 11.21, I would like to be earlier, but I got late because I didn't plan it well. It will affect just slightly, I have to hurry a little more. We have to open at 12.30 and I must be about 10 minutes from arrival. I have not only had a coffee, I have not had breakfast. I currently feel like eating, but maybe I'll buy a mole cake. And that's it. Right now in the Costa Coral account there was a little more money than expected, so I feel a little more relaxed. I'm thinking that the change we made in the menu is allowing us to be a little more profitable, I don't know. Usually, it's happening that the money I expect to have in the postage account, there is always a little more. And although we are still battling with money, it gives me a little hope that although the sales are low right now, and we are improving sales a little more, we will be able to keep a little more of the money from the sales that are missing.

[9/9/25, 4:04 AM] Today we sold not too much and not too little. It was fine. This in the restaurant.

[9/9/25, 4:04 AM] I need to go to bed early.

[9/9/25, 4:07 AM] My dad gave me money to pay Costa Coral debt. This will buy me some tranquility. But I need to keep moving so the lost in money is reduced and hopefully ends and Costa Coral can stop being a worry and more a dream come true.

[9/9/25, 4:08 AM] If I could choose, I would go to bed at 9pm

[9/10/25, 1:29 AM] The idea is that they follow a survey within Facebook, so that people can select their preferences, where they would like to go to eat. and the site will direct them, depending on their preferences, to a site that has those preferences, but would have a slight ... like a slight preference or cost per hour, and we would unify what each person pays for the fund. that would give publicity to this site within Facebook and be able to position it well, including cutting the next month to 80, 70 and so on.

[9/10/25, 1:30 AM] I have passed the time of the day, I have not done much, however I think I needed to rest to regain energies and now I need to structure what I want to do to accelerate and make the decisions that allow us to generate more income quickly and avoid spending the little money we have and find ourselves again in the circumstances in which we were. So, we have to analyze our opportunities and select the one that has the most chances of being successful. All of this refers to Costa Coral.

[9/10/25, 2:08 AM] I have problems, I am not able to plan a task or even a goal of a task that I want to do. I wonder if I can make an application that is very fast to do, in which I write something I want to do, and maybe a time limit in which I should do it. I don't know, I would like to explore that idea. I write the task, and the task is present on the screen. And there's a timer, I don't know how to explain it. And there can be both things even with a list of things that I have achieved that I have achieved and maybe a percentage of success and error and there must also be like a kind of active minutes where only the actions that I really did that can add up to that active time. That is, if I want to make a design for an ad, and I have 15 minutes to do it, and I define it as it is, Those 15 minutes add up to the time. If I don't finish it, I can't add it. It would be interesting as a game. I would make a cool, interesting, modern interface.

[9/10/25, 5:21 AM] Yes, what I think is that we can work on the website project for the purposes of MR Marketing for Costa Coral.

[9/10/25, 5:22 AM] Again it's 6.20, 6.22 at night and I still haven't slept. I would love to start sleeping at 9, 9.30 maybe. But I end up doing other things that maybe aren't productive.

[9/10/25, 5:23 AM] Right now I created a site based on the idea of percentile feedback. I would like to read the chapter in the book that refers to this concept and how I can incorporate it. Right now, I don't even know if I can save it, if it stays recorded, as in a kind of... in a kind of database, but the interface is good.

[9/10/25, 5:38 AM] I find dictating with my voice very practical and it is very interesting.

[9/10/25, 6:20 AM] In my free time I mainly go on distractors like Twitter, YouTube, among others. I'm sure that if I take advantage of those few times for other activities, even if it was 40 minutes, 30 minutes, things like design, programming, among others, I could advance in the projects that really interest me, for example, that I had a period of 40 minutes a day to program the system of the videos for restaurants surely I would have something more elaborate that could be selling with the same time I have right now but I get distracted and I do it this very conscious many times that my mind only seeks distraction in the immediate reward that many times is translated, for example, to play polytopia, which is a strategy game that only makes me not think anything and this and not in things that maybe the reward takes time to be visible for example as in a project that requires programming and that aligns for example with my desire to use artificial intelligence and have a more office work than instead of being in the restaurant

[9/10/25, 6:37 AM] 40 min in my app for videos for restaurants per day will be a huge win. This will create a doble oportunity for earning extra money. It could work to bring extra clients to the restaurant and also as a service to sell to other restaurants. I plan to sell it at $3600mxn per month per costumer

[9/10/25, 5:42 PM] Well, I woke up late, like 8.50 and it was morning, come to buy some things, take a shower, have breakfast, wash a little bit of clothes and I'm going to be late. I didn't do what I wanted to do, I didn't have the 40 minutes of focused work time. Yes, obviously it was because I slept at night and that has a chain effect that is not more satisfactory.

[9/10/25, 5:45 PM] Well, it is clear to me that as the owner of Costa Coral, I am his engine. So, I have to define the steps we take and also the rhythm we take. I am the most interested and if I do not take action, if I do not define goals, This does not advance us and this is not because of the lack of interest of others, but they follow my rhythm. So I think I have a good team and many things I don't even have to do, I just have to indicate what steps have to be taken to advance. So I have to tune those things, set goals, make the step, delegate. I had identified this before, but I had not had the opportunity to apply it. I don't know what happens to me sometimes. I think I have to have those clearer plans.

[9/11/25, 12:41 AM] I have a problem that I have identified a while back. I start a project and after a few hours I switch to another and so on. This doesn't let me build something of great value because my progress is spread all over the place. Apart from the restaurant I haven't spent so much in something for long time

[9/11/25, 12:45 AM] I'm considering starting a B2B business instead of a B2C like the restaurant. Currently is very hard to earn money in the restaurant. I think we will have more lucky with less effort to sell a service like the videos for restaurants

[9/11/25, 2:58 PM] i went to bed at 9:20pm yesterday, unfortunatelly my habits of sleeping late, made me sleep around 11:00pm and today I wake up around 8:30pm. Still satisfied that I did my part, even as I didnt achieve what I wanted. I suppose it takes time to change something I did bad for so long. Also I didnt spend time on my phone as a first task of the day as many days I did. Now logging this info. Will write what I want to do for the day, and do even a small portion of focused work.

[9/11/25, 3:26 PM] I have two things to do one is make people go to Costa Coral. We need to capture the attention of those who havent went to Costa Coral, there is a lost of interest to our buffet. Even as we have improved our offering. 

Do I simply need to change the creatives, maybe people is tired of seeng over and over the same images. 

Maybve that is necessary, even if the image + text has performing not as bad. 

But one thing for sure is that the method is not perfoming as well as it did at the begining. 

Other idea is to lower the price of pthe buffet basico to $199 all days. This will help us in the marketing efforts. I belioeve. To advertise it as a buffet de $199

Another idea is to compare us with other buffets, the cheap ones and the expensive ones. And show us as the smart choice. where you get premium ingredients and recepies for small price and all you can eat. 

Its true that we dont advertice everything we have to offer. This could be the oportunity. A fast video that says something like. 

Buscas un Buffet? Pero no uno tan costoso de $500 donde te quedes sin dinero si llevas a la familia. 
Pero tampoco uno donde pagues $160 y sean 4 o 5 cosas basicas? 

Costa Coral es la opcion ideal, donde puedes comer tacos, de camaron, pescado, arrachera, langosta, calamar. 25 recetas. hechas a mano. por tan solo $269. 

Todo lo preparamos con tortilla a mano. 

Cada taco es una excusa para probar una de nuestros complementos, desde salsa de tamarindo, jamaica, hasta nuestra popular mezcla de pepino con chile piquin y zanahoria. 

Pide los que quieras y preparalos como quieras. 

We need to condense this idea in something very short. To convey the offering in very few words and images. 

I already like it. 

We need to speak to our costumers in a personal level, i think. Not as a corporation, but in a engaging way. First broading the question to engage the costumer and then narrowing it down to something very specigfic to the thing we want. 

Sounds fine by me. 

What is next, the other project. The one that will take me away from this maddness. The one that will allow me more flexibility and the possibility to earn more with less effort. 

Why didnt I try to do something else? instead of going for another restaurant. Maybe I operated with less infoprmation that I wish I had, or naybely though that La Palmita was a very bad project and something more planeed will work better and be a lot easier. 

The truth is something that is broadly known, a restaurant is something hard to do. specially in a town like my own, Morelia. Where there is almost no industry and many people gravitates to start a food place, so the offering is too much for the small amount of people. So is very hard to attaract costuomers in a place crowded with tons of options.

[9/11/25, 8:28 PM] It's a Thursday, it's time to go to the corral, it's 2.30 and we haven't sold anything. I'm slightly stressed but also at the same time a little excited to take the decision to start another type of business that is more digital and that brings a source of income and at the same time that is easier to execute and not so tired.

[9/12/25, 1:13 AM] Well, I don't know what to say, I'm still thinking about the idea of ​​generating content, but content of videos, in this case for restaurants, but there is something that I had not, I had thought about it, but I think it is a bigger problem than I imagined. What is it? A problem I see is that it can have difficulty climbing. when you have many content creators it may be difficult to coordinate with them that you are bad with the clients and with each new client we have more costs since they are paid for visits. A solution that could be to have as routes where a creator can complete a route instead of paying for video, it is paid per day and ask him to create more videos that can be an option the idea is to make it more scalable that it does not cost so expensive with each new client I do not know I have to analyze and implement an idea although it is not the most efficient but already starting because we are going to see

[9/12/25, 1:16 AM] Well, I need to act quickly, just to validate that I am sure that the people, the restaurant owners, willing to pay for ... I even dare to say not necessarily for someone to solve the problem of having more people, but simply to try something else, that they want to try something else with the hope that the problem of that their restaurant is alone is resolved. I suspect that this is a very, very widespread problem in the city, since I dare to say that we are few people for so many food businesses that we have. because there is almost no industry because most people prefer to start a food business because it is what they know best to do instead of starting a something else that requires more maybe technical skills, so that's what is oversaturated and there are only a few that have that mindshare, I don't know.

[9/12/25, 1:17 AM] So, my solution, regardless of whether it works or not, I mean in practical terms, in this case it would be to take a place from not having people to having people. I think it could be sold simply by the fact of promising that it can be done. and well, it may not work for some, but I think that is better than our old model where we are a restaurant and we have to force it. We are a business to customer and we are a very transparent model where we have to work to be able to charge the client. if not, it does not arrive in change in the other independently if it works or not we charge at the time of selling then this can be done with calls to the close to the client it can be a little easier

[9/12/25, 1:25 AM] What do I mean by creating a service where you can charge regardless of whether it works or not? It's very simple. I realized that a restaurant or a boutique The effort is very transparent. You have to do it on several fronts and you only charge when a client visits you. That is, when all the parts are already good. The food is good, the service is good, the marketing effort is good, the location, etc. It is when you discover that it is already ... and for that to happen is difficult. I think so If a component is bad you will very likely break I don know how to define it but the whole cycle must work to make it a profitable place, especially in places, for example, where I live, where I have the belief that because there is no industry, many people gravitate to put places for food and in comparison we have places, for example, advertising agencies where their results should not attract more customers necessarily to cover, they can be only very good at sales or they can be very good at design and at the moment with this they convince the client and the client will discover that they are not a part that they are going to to turn those efforts into money, until within 3, 4 months, but simply that cycle already allowed you to look for more customers and so on. However, in place of food, I think all the components must work.

[9/12/25, 1:29 AM] maybe what I mean is is that 1 when separating the components there are certain businesses that can do bad things and still receive income, for example, maybe a teacher, a psychologist, for example, a psychologist, independently, if he is doing a good job is very easy to evaluate it is being sorry it is very difficult to evaluate in the first second third visit even the doctors it can be difficult to evaluate And I think that in a restaurant a person immediately, I don't know, I don't know how to tie these ideas because also if we as restaurant owners, we know immediately, for example, if our way of acquiring clients is bad. That is a great incentive, sorry, a great asset to iterate. Practically every week you iterate, you iterate until you start to find the pieces that fit. So why Well I have reiterated perhaps not enough I think I have reiterated a lot within Costa Coral but perhaps not enough to benefit from this I do not know if I stagnate I simply have to wait for the effect of the recommendations to be bigger and bigger and we can live from these recommendations as it happened in the palm tree the other restaurant where it took me I think a year and during that year because many times we were alone although all the pieces were in that place we only had to wait for the voice to spread and this effect was created where and on all the weekends there were people who recommended it to us and so I wish I would like to wait but I do not know on the one hand I want to leave this job the restaurant one and look for something more in my in my ... that I think I have more domain, something that has to do with artificial intelligence, that I can have more free time, but at the same time I know that I am not going to leave the other, then Coral Coast stays, we are going to try to rescue it but I think I am also in a very interesting position where I know the pain points of a restaurant and at the same time I have the technological knowledge to offer an idea of ​​how to solve them. The point is to find that part of how it is solved.

[9/12/25, 1:32 AM] Of course, with this that I say, it is not that I planned to sell a solution that I know is false, on the contrary, I would try my best, but what I mean is that if you have an incomplete solution in a restaurant, it is not viable. However, there are other situations where a partial solution is functional. And you can continue iterating, do what I mean.

[9/12/25, 3:25 AM] With going to bed early. I think I need to complement it with having a light and healthy dinner

[9/12/25, 3:26 AM] It's 9:25pm I know I need to go to bed, but we came with some friends to eat tacos. What should I do?

[9/12/25, 4:27 AM] It's 10.26 pm. On one hand I feel like I should do something on the computer, move forward or whatever, and on the other hand I know I have to go to bed. What should I do? I don't know. I know that the logical thing is to go to bed early so that tomorrow I can try to wake up early and immediately start doing something productive.

[9/12/25, 4:28 AM] I was thinking about the same idea that artificial intelligence gave me, about what is a small and imperfect action that I can take, that even if it fails, it will teach me something real about my plan to create my new business.

[9/12/25, 1:48 PM] Wake up early, but felt sleepy so end up sleeping until 7:40am. Time to work!

[9/12/25, 1:57 PM] will start by making a list of things that if done by the end of the day I will feel proud of.

[9/12/25, 5:54 PM] Ok, today, as I mentioned, I woke up early, relatively, and one of my goals was to make a TikTok ad. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it because there was a step where I got stuck, in which I could no longer advance. It was a step where I linked the landing page to the ad. And although I could do most of it, there was something in the TikTok interface that didn't allow me. I want to think that this was not my responsibility, but it was a process of waiting. Obviously I would have liked to do more things, for example, make more ads for Facebook, for Costa Coral, however, most of my time was spent on this and having a work announcement for the workers' application. and there it was all the time. I would have liked to have more time for tomorrow. And well, I did not expect that I was going to get stuck in that part. Anyway, I'm satisfied with what I achieved, although it was not a relatively failed attempt, because right now it will not have results with the campaign.

[9/12/25, 5:56 PM] Maybe if I had liked to be a little more productive, I would have selected the tasks first, where there was a higher chance of success, and rank them based on that and maybe return on the time investment, maybe that could be done, how much time it probably requires, the probability that the desired goal is achieved and create a score. I don't know, it would be something relatively easy to implement. I could be implementing tasks that I want to do and not only one day before, but constantly trying to do in the morning the ones that have the best score.

[9/12/25, 5:57 PM] I constantly see the change in the turn of many things. That they are business customers. And although this may be, because it is obvious when a business customer closes, and even if this business is not so easy to see, But this in a way reaffirms my vision, perhaps partial, that a business to business has more chances of success and that we should make the change from business to customer to business

[9/15/25, 4:31 AM] thinking on building this site> 

This will be a site that will ask potential costumers their preferences and based on that will suggest highly rated places on Morelia that will fit their needs. 

It removes the need for discovery in social media.

The type of questions that it might ask are maybe:

+ What kind of food do you like
+ Loud or music to talk
+ Cheap or Expensive
+ I want to be surprised or go to a sure thing
+ Etc. 

It could be a glorified form. But with the right design, UX and UI we can make a site that it will actually drive costumers to the right place. A kind of router, that drives traffic according to the preferences, it could even ask after the visit if the recommendation was according to the expectations. 

Here we could make a profit by giving tons of traffic to the site using a pool of the people paying for the service in this way we leverage the traffic of all social media to a smart traffic light that moves people to the right location. 

Yes, we have tiktok, facebook, instagram and other places that put all restaurants to fight for the attention of users, while not being very efficient, because is a zero sum game. Also the tools are not made especially for a city with our necesities like Morelia. Instead is a general tool.
Here we have a chance to pool the resources of all our clients and suggest to costumers places that they will actually like. 

Currently there is a problem where small, new places in Morelia don't get traffic, this will level the field and if the site is good, we might give it a boost in the ratings. 

We could use smart algos to place sites and even charge them only on people clicking in their actual listings. Who knows. Or Maybe charge to put the profile of their restaurant with more detail than the rest. 

Here the potential for profit lies in the cost to the traffic to the site and the effect we cause in the restaurant of the client. 

Even if the results that they drive with direct ads on social media, I think we can frame it in a way that sounds like another source of costumers. 

I would be interested in paying for the site, as a restaurant owner, if I saw it with life. I mean, proof that people is actually using it, with comments and others signals of activity. Even pay for it around $600-$800 mxn per month only to see if it works. 
We could leverage the fact that many places don't even track where costumers come from.

[9/17/25, 12:28 AM] Today we expected it to be a day of high sales, well, not of high sales, but higher than normal, because it is a festive day. And we had observed that usually days like this one, well, they were not going well. Unfortunately, it was not like that. We lost a little and I am really a little disappointed. because it is very beautiful because there is another place that has more people than us and it is a place that makes you think

[9/17/25, 12:29 AM] This month, in the Costa Coral restaurant, we are projecting that it will be one of the lowest months. And this is coming from a streak, more of a constant where every month we sell slightly low. Well, I'm worried that what we had we are losing. What did we have? I don't know. Or that we are doing something wrong. I don't know.

[9/17/25, 12:34 AM] An explanation that could give us an explanation of why it has dropped so much, it could be that we already announced the price of the Camaro lobster, That, combined with a mistake in the design of that ad, but that actually worked as something positive, where we mixed the image of a... of a... this... a pickled taco... with the name of lobster. In reality it was a mistake, but the client thought that the lobster taco was that big lobster taco. That is my hypothesis. So, I have not used that photo anymore, because I feel that it is very used, but that could be an explanation. So we could try that hypothesis in an easy way maybe looking for a way to put shrimp lobster or lobster taco in a taco that has that shape that looks very voluminous and try if we have demand and this then that could be the problem that people seek to try something original, something new, at an affordable price and the lobster taco fulfilled it. Now it does not fulfill it and that is why we have had that decline. So we could also incorporate the idea I had in mind of making caviar tacos. I don't know what the flavor would be, but I suspect it would be good. And it says something curious, even buy two cans think about it until we put a disclaimer, that says until the existences allow it, something like that, and try if that is really what is failing us.

[9/17/25, 12:45 AM] I have been working on an application where people, depending on their needs, of the places where they want to meet, where they want to go to eat, for example if it is a family, a couple, etc. We are going to recommend a place, asking simple questions, and the idea is to generate money by charging the restaurants, for example, to appear with a certain image or certain details that increase the probability that the person is going to be there. I was thinking of charging 890 pesos in the basic plan.

[9/17/25, 12:45 AM] In this software that I am creating, where you can ask questions, we are going to recommend it has two objectives. First, I want to think that if I think it can serve the restaurant, it can serve our restaurant, it can serve all restaurants.

[9/17/25, 12:47 AM] And I definitely need another income to stabilize myself. This income, we were talking about it, it would have to be around 15,000 pesos. I think that with 15,000 additional per month that you receive, 15,000 to 20,000. I could be very stable and maintain Coral and all the costs that are happening. I would like to know how many clients there are. If I were the only one working there, I would sell this service, but I would include Flor, since she has proven to be very creative, very hardworking, and I have the suspicion that she is very good at selling software solutions. Thank you.

[9/17/25, 12:49 AM] So, let's say that I want 15,000. That's what I'm talking about. If I enter Flow, in the creation and sale of this service, we could get about 30 clients. That are not being misled. If I can only create something that really serves the restaurants. Well, yes, that it serves the restaurants, to be more visible, even start selling other types of services, like your website, a landing page where you can communicate with them via WhatsApp, something like what we did for Costa Coral, not to reserve but to end up in a whatsapp contact I feel that we could sell it, digital menus, all the solutions that we have found and that can be useful to you I wonder what are the next steps that I must take to start generating even if it costs 5,000 pesos.

[9/17/25, 2:33 AM] Now coding is possible using AI. The weird part is that it can work for long periods of time. This periods doesn't make too much sense to try to be in deep work. Because you only have to wait seen no updates. I wonder what could I do in those moments (2 to 12 min ). What could I do? In those moments? And also how could I motive myself to "code" with this new tools that don't require so much focus and more constant iteration. Think from first principles.

[9/18/25, 6:38 AM] I read this about myself from another AI and got me thinking: Your core failure mode is irreversibility avoidance: you protect optionality and image by doing reversible work (tweaks, research, tool-hopping) instead of committing to live outputs that create external feedback and potential embarrassment. That keeps you “busy,” prevents compounding, and starves the system of data.

[9/20/25, 6:16 PM] Today is Diana's birthday. Diana, my wife, is married to me. From what I interpret, what happened, as I can read, she sees, Yes, I did not give him a special treatment, he is present, he is all right. I told him that he was not going to be here, he was going to go quickly because he had things to do here. I agree. This obviously bothered me. And I stopped talking. As for me, I know there is not much to say. I tired of seeing how to survive in the coral coast to be without money all the time to see how we can survive a few more days This affects my planning and, for example, I said that if I had planned it better, I could have left much later. But my mind didn't even let me think today how I was going to And well, a little detail, a small gift from Diana would have been fine and I said that with that we would have been back. But I didn't do it. And I don't know, right now things are going very badly with Diana. I'm tired of fighting so many fronts and not having a space to really rest because I come from work tired and Diana is angry. I go to work and I'm worried about bad sales and get tired.

[9/20/25, 6:23 PM] This note is to remind me, in a given case, that Diana and I are not separated, that Diana can be very rude to me. What do I mean by rude? That she can remove the word very easily from me, due to some problem that she had personally, And then, days or weeks later, I found out that it was not a situation that was alien to me, but she does not discriminate and she stops talking to me. I found out that this pattern is a pattern that his mother made. I removed the word from her when she got angry with children, and I found out this from Saul, and that's exactly what Diana does with me.

[9/20/25, 6:25 PM] Diana can also change her mood very easily, so sometimes I can withdraw and go to work in a happy way, and I return, waiting to find Diana herself, to make a short talk, to make a comment, and I find myself not being able to talk anymore. This has happened on many occasions, and I don't know why. It's like talking to the wall and not talking to me. And later I found out, as I say on other occasions, that sometimes it is not even an action that I did, it is simply a matter of work or someone, of his brother, and that is the one that I'm going to repeat the word. And that's very humiliating because obviously I asked the same question or comment two or three times thinking that he didn't hear me, but in reality he decided not to talk. So, I'm tired of that, and I want to remember them at some point. Diana and I will finish, because my brain tends to forget bad things, and only remember the good things.

[9/20/25, 6:29 PM] I suppose that in all relationships there are good and bad moments, but with Diana sometimes those bad moments are very repetitive, I don't minimize or say that I have been right all the time, of course not, but if, let's say, every two weeks she gets upset, I can't say that even once a week he gets upset to the point of not talking to me, getting angry. I tired tired And I think this is not a bad perception of mine I think there really is a situation with her that I should have seen since we were dating. But I don't know what was going to happen to me when I got there 15 minutes late, 20 minutes late. And I was so angry that the whole exit was ruined that day. Or when I finished, just when my parents had separated. We came back and everything, but I think that's what I'm talking about, about someone who is not very aware of me. needs, worries, I don't know.

[9/20/25, 6:37 PM] something that I owe to and well it is obvious but I still have not realized so much that the restaurant depends a lot on online sales practically I dare to say that we are close to 100% like 90% and You can read this in two ways, as we are taking advantage of social networks, but we are also taking advantage of a very big opportunity that we have, and that I dare to say that it is statistically highly likely to extract an income. It is our location in Bucareli, where there is a relatively high traffic in the standards of Morelia, or let's say, low-middle, maybe it could be, where we could sell something at a low cost. We had already observed it before that 169 Buffett sorry 129 sold even if it were in limited quantities In two days we managed to sell if I remember correctly 6 buffets Well, it would be worth exploring or continuing to explore more. how we can generate income, I don't even get tired of trying to get 3,000 a month with the traffic from Monday to Friday, since from Saturday to Sunday there is almost none. So, we have not explored that option. If we did not have social networks, we would sell zero pesos, the majority of the virus. And I feel that if we just work a little bit, we could have sales of 300, 400 pesos a day, from Monday to Friday. Let's say, from 400, 400, that would be 8,000 extra pesos in sales, which would be nothing for a very small effort.

[9/21/25, 8:27 AM] Currently thinking a lot on how the little money I spend on TikTok generated good money for Costa coral, to be more precise, I spend $250 mxn and got $5000 MXN in total sales aprox. Probably we need to make more tests, but is very encouraging, and with better videos I think we can get better results.

[9/24/25, 12:11 AM] because I saw a good response with ads on TikTok, which we could say was an investment of $400 in ads and the total return on sales was around $5,500. makes me consider that it is important to announce the Costa Coral restaurant on TikTok and maybe reduce the investment that was being made on Facebook from 6,000 pesos a month to just 3,000 and in the other 3,000 directly to TikTok.

[9/24/25, 12:13 AM] tomorrow we are going to start selling again in Uber Eats this is important since it will be the first time that we start selling since we started selling tacos in Costa Coda more than a year ago that we did not try it, however, I think my aggressive strategy can work where we are only going to look for a 10% margin on all expenses and this 10% will be reimbursed in ads, possibly we have a slight loss but this is going to be to acquire users who repeat this I think this can work and I would like to elaborate on that plan but for now I think it is enough

[9/24/25, 12:16 AM] I must say that the investment in ads that I made in tiktok of 400 pesos that generated 5,500 was on the weekend I imagine that in three weeks the return will be much less then this maybe it is worth trying it but I consider that it would have a similar behavior than facebook where most of the sales are focused on it on the weekend this is on Saturday Sunday I suspect that in my city morelia michoacán there are not many people who have the capacity or the time freedom to go to visit a buffet in three weeks at least at our prices maybe there we could fill our unused production capacity in Uber Eats which we are going to try the day of tomorrow

[9/24/25, 4:50 PM] I slept again last night. In this case, yesterday I went to sleep at 2 a.m. And obviously I woke up late. I woke up at 9 a.m. and even though I will arrive on time to work, I did not manage to do what I had to do I did not do any productive activity before going to work I don't know, I feel like I obviously failed again, in something that is relatively easy, I say.

[9/24/25, 4:53 PM] to yesterday, which was my day off, well, I think I wasted a lot of time, not necessarily doing nothing, but using it as it should be to recharge energies, really rest. Maybe I should have slept for a while, or go to see a movie. However, I left on things that I don't even remember. Not even having a plan of how to enjoy my day, which I think can be useful. However, although it was my day off, I took the opportunity to upload some images for the Uber Eats store. And the idea is to start today with the store and waiting to have at least a couple of sales for Uber Eats, let's hope, and start getting information. I want to find the balance where, practically, even if we don't have profit, we can get enough money to reinvest it in ads and so we can grow a client base that we can repeat later. Obviously, we can fail. The strategy through Uber Eats will be low cost. since we have enough capacity without using in the restaurant and this I want to use it right now for now simply in acquiring new clients in Uber Eats and then deactivate the ads to stay with that margin

[9/24/25, 6:27 PM] Silvestre Carrillo Rasa y Elon Esquivel, se presentaron el día de hoy 24 de septiembre a las 12:24. Para ntoficar del resultado de una vista que nos realizaron el 3 de septiembre. Son del SAT.

[9/25/25, 7:27 AM] we did a test on Uber Eats today, we only have a couple of orders and one was from my sister. This was the test today, we need to try to improve tomorrow. Now we will have images in more of our products and hopefully a new image in the listings. that will increase our CTR, also I added a BOGO for one of our tacos. with this i hope we can at least have 3 orders. When I refer to today, i mean miercoles and tomorrow jueves

[9/25/25, 7:28 AM] I need to try to sleep, even if I find omarchy awesome. Omarchy is a linux OS. It seems that its limitations are great for focused work.

[9/27/25, 10:03 PM] Thinking how to make Costa Coral as low cost as possible for us. For this I need to lower the expenses as much as possible. I need to think about as a bet. Where the daily bet is for sure a winning one. Currently our expenses is so high that having a winning bet is hard

[9/27/25, 10:27 PM] I'm thinking using TikTok as a advertising channel for our landing page ReservaCoral.com or simply to make users come by is working great around 10x ROAS. At least what we have managed to track, it could be higher. Probably I need to increase my production of tiktoks. And spending on ads on them. The results have been visible only by spending 400 mxn at most in a few days. Probably I need to spend a lot more. And maybe considering selling the combo TikTok ads and landing page. With around $6000 a month, keeping $3000 and spending the rest on ads to make the funnel work.

[9/30/25, 4:34 AM] we recived today 2 tables on costa coral they came from tiktok. the two tables spend 1000 mxn in total. and i spend today 100 mxn on ads on tiktok. I strarting to think that tiktok is a great way to bring sales to costa coral. I need to find the courage to buy the equipment i need to make more videos for tiktok for costa coral. I know how to make good videos. I am creative. I have found a way to make a profit out of them. 10x ROAS. I find it hard to spend when I dont have money, but this seems from the first tests a good idea, I just need to do it

[11/3/25, 4:56 PM] I have been bathing with water for two occasions, practically cold or almost cold, and the feeling is that I feel more awake, more comfortable. I think I could benefit a lot if I did this, or I would like to do this constantly, but I don't know how to live. Right now I'm doing it because we practically have gas in the house, but I think it would be a good practice, a good habit.

[11/3/25, 4:59 PM] Yesterday, November 2, an administrative letter was raised to Leslie for not fulfilling a direct order from her superior, in this case Flor. I think I should document this more. I mean in the city of Costa Coral, the restaurant I have.

[11/12/25, 8:11 PM] I have observed the new worker, consume food, I need to verify if it is conform to the rules or not, I also need to give it the new regulation

[11/13/25, 6:30 AM] I will like to log where my time goes. Specially right now that I am at the restaurant (Costa coral)

[11/13/25, 6:31 AM] I feel like I could be doing more with my time. If I managed to spend it more wisely. And not in distractions that don't leave me to much

[11/13/25, 6:34 AM] I think we have increased our sales at Costa Coral, thanks to TikTok. Past month we reached 140,000 mxn aprox. I think at least 30,000 mxn was thanks to TikTok.

[11/18/25, 11:52 PM] I have stopped updating the latest events in Costa Coral, which I think are relevant. Right now we are in November and sales are doing very well. I plan sales between 145,000 and 165,000 pesos, mainly from our Creo, which has contributed a lot to our spending on TikTok. and also good that content has been created there in TikTok and maybe not exactly but according to our survey many people come to mention that it goes from TikTok could tell me that a third part at least arrives from TikTok others from Facebook and others of recommendation, what is going to

[11/18/25, 11:54 PM] In August, I think we sold around $82,000 and this was due, I think, by external circumstances, where the general sale went down and we would have sold less, I think maybe about $60,000, 50,000 but fortunately the last two weeks was that I started to see the opportunity to publish us on TikTok and well, this has increased sales in those last two weeks or last week that already helped us in those sales and later in the next month in the month of October we managed to sell around 140,000 pesos.

[11/18/25, 11:56 PM] So, yes, TikTok has been a very effective tool, especially because it complements the other efforts that are being made on Facebook. and well, fortunately, many people have recommended us, so little by little we help ourselves with all those factors, all those sources of traffic, However, I must say that the profit is still limited. We need to optimize that part. One problem is that we do not sell alcohol because we do not have the license to sell it. This is very expensive, it costs 60,000 pesos and right now it has not been able to be put together. and we are only limited by what the buffet generates, the food. Approximately, I think that the profit we have is around 17% of the total sales and I want to take it at least to 25%, but I know that many adjustments have to be made. Yes, there are many artists.

[11/18/25, 11:57 PM] We recently hired a new collaborator, I think it's her second week, or a week and a half, and well, very efficient, it works fast, although I am a little worried, there is something about it that does not convince me, but if it is very efficient it is very fast and it learns fast, this has made the cost of the staff increase, this one I am paying her two thousand pesos weekly and this one She is called Flor, just like Flor, my former worker. And I am... I will refer to the new worker with another name to be able to differentiate them.

[11/19/25, 2:16 AM] I will describe to give more details of the buffet, because in the buffet, the taco buffet Costa Coral, mainly tacos appear and people can order as many times as they want, from the time they arrive until 6.30, we open at 1 pm although workers arrive at 11 am. The average consumption of tacos is 7, if I remember correctly, around 6.8 or something like that. We have a bar with sauces and other supplements so that customers can prepare their own tacos, so we take them very basically and they prepare them. This with the idea of costs in the kitchen serving it quickly and this this is the basic idea as I have said on other occasions we have seen an increase in demand thanks to this a tick tock then because it is tick tock facebook recommendation and very little margin the people who pass very little those who pass and enter but then already by putting together the various sources because this one is created a this one a significant amount of traffic although the unlimited income at the moment due to what we have left after doing all the payments, it is around 17% of profit and to have an idea of much that means for example here in the house the rent is 7 A hamburger at McDonald is costing about 120 130 I think A pizza at Little Caesar is costing about $ 120, $ 130 I think. Just to take into account those proportions. How much is it generating, for example, the cost per hour. My goal is to try to reduce our expense per person in the buffet and increasing the expense, what each person spends on the buffet. For example, with upgrades that they can do, I have considered that they can buy fried potatoes or guacamole and try to increase the profit a little more and in turn make them fill themselves with these supplements since I hope that by consuming this they can eat less tacos as they will be eating it while they receive the tacos but I have to make sure that it is actually a savings Although if they themselves are going to pay for those upgrades, it would not affect us, since once we wanted to give them additional things, and what happened is that they still kept asking for the same 7 tacos, but the last one they no longer ate, they only asked for it and left it there. What makes me think that people will order 7 tacos, regardless of the ... regardless of the ... if we make some changes to fill them before, they feel that consuming 7, they are already ... taking away what they paid for the buffet.

[11/19/25, 2:23 AM] Currently we handle two buffets, the basic buffet of 199 pesos and the premium buffet of 269 pesos. I think that currently that price is an attractive price for people. 199 pesos is below a mental barrier. and people can perceive it as a good value. Once we tried it with 219 pesos, the basic buffet, and I feel that people did not feel so attracted to that price as the one of 199. I think it is a good decision to maintain that price and reduce the cost of food For example right now I calculate that the cost of Cox cost of goods is 41% of our total sales, of the 41% of the sale of the product and we could lower it if we manage to make people buy, sorry, select inside the buffet, cheaper tacos and reduce the cost of production of these tacos, which, well, it costs me work to think how we would achieve it, but maybe through experimentation a systematized experimentation we could maybe achieve it For example try to have two minuses with a slight variation to see with which of the two we get cheaper. People ask for the cheapest options I would like to know for example what is the utility margin in each of the options and see if moving people from one to another we can increase our income but Well, the basic buffet of 199 is ours, the one we publish in social networks and I feel that it is the one that makes people dare to try since 199 does not feel so expensive as a reference seafood buffets cost $ 289, $ 299 and although we do not offer Agua Chiles or options that are called Barra Fría, which are like Agua Chiles, and other options, because we are tacos that maybe we want to focus on that, in being leaders and recognized for being a buffet taco, but at the same time I am worried that people are not willing to pay for a taco, since here in Mexico tacos are perceived as cheap economic tacos,

[11/20/25, 3:18 PM] I usually wake up and spend a few minutes on the cell phone in bed sometimes it can be 20, sometimes it can be half an hour, sometimes it can be up to an hour and well, yes, I feel that I waste a lot of time in the morning when I wake up and spend a lot of time on the cell phone and usually that time, well, this one is looking for me, it is late and I do not do the races and I do not manage to do what I wanted

[11/20/25, 3:20 PM] for the time being today, it is already 9.18 or 9.19 in fact, and I will hurry to see if at least I am not so pressured today, I will try to I think that registering more information about me this day is important. It has helped me a lot and to see where I am failing. I need to make the restaurant more profitable. Solving the problem with the card payment terminal, since the bank can delay those payments until a week which affects me a lot in general and this and let's see what follows

[11/25/25, 6:54 PM] I have been considering the idea of increasing the cost of the project. This with the idea, with two ideas. One, reduce the cost of the staff. And with this same, I mean, because I suppose that if the cost increases, the demand will decrease. And with a decrease in demand, or less staff. Currently, with Turate, on the weekend there are five people hired, and in three weeks there are three but that puts us in a very vulnerable position since our demand is not consistent as I think it can go down a lot in three weeks and if the demand goes down a lot, immediately everything goes away in even lose money. So, with a slightly higher price, well, a higher price, I assure you that the demand is not so high and if it continues to be high, of that increase in the price because it would have a major profit and could offer its problems better is that it is giving the basic buffet to 199 and the buffet premium to 269 My utility margin, I calculate that it is within 17%, which means that the effort that is made with what is obtained is very little.

[11/25/25, 6:56 PM] So I would like to explore the idea that the 199 buffet, which we call the basic one, becomes a buffet in three weeks, which will only be available from Monday to Friday, and we could leave it at 199 or increase it to 219 pesos and the premium buffet would cost 269 and only offer it on weekends. In this way, we would force the weekly clients that we have the highest demand to offer only the one that leaves us the most money, since the basic buffet costs us around 89 to 90 pesos and the premium buffet costs us 119 pesos.

[11/25/25, 7:02 PM] I already have more or less how much it costs me. Having high expenses puts you in a very vulnerable position in a restaurant, since in a month's time you must immediately make orders and high orders. In fact, it makes me think that we must look for a way to operate with the minimum possible staff, with a good margin of profitability. Maybe it would be interesting to explore. We are selling 150,000 right now, with fixed expenses of 50,000, but practically, when there is a percent of food expenses which I know is expensive high so we have to fix that margin One is making people prefer the one that we can force on Saturdays and Sundays and this one since on Saturdays and Sundays we have more demand and this one can be that on Saturdays and Sundays we can only force the prize We have a good group of people. It was not a basic buffet. The weekend was a good one. The people in the room are very calm. That could be an excellent way to decrease the number of people who come to the weekends To find a way even to explore what happens if with this restructuring, we could serve three people, two in the kitchen and one on the floor, making the kitchen and the locker room. It would have to be simulations to see what happens if we only sell 6,000, 7,000 pesos, but with this restructuring, see how much it corresponds and this in profit of the weekend and we could make that change. This would be interesting. And if not, then reverse it because I currently feel, and this is something that I bring to you very present, the difficulty and the workload is very high with the return that is obtained The return is very low I think that to do it to make it feel like it was worth it we require about 25 I would have to plan it, print it all, have it ready. and execute it as soon as possible. In this way, I could only keep the resources of the staff, offer a better service, and and pay a little more to the floor so that it can be modified. It would also be recommended for the increase, by the workers, for the increase in tips, since they will be less and the margin will be higher.

[11/27/25, 5:16 PM] After the analysis I did with ChatGPT, I realized that we must do two things. One is to increase the cost of the buffet. This so that it makes more sense. Although I thought that, for example, extract 100, 160 pesos per client. But it is a prudent strategy, regardless of the cost that the ingredients of the products that consume have. The problem or the variable that I had taken into account is that generating those 100 or 160 pesos requires a very high labor cost, which is not something I am going to consider. So, taking that into account, I came to the conclusion that we cannot continue offering the same price, of and for our buffets So I have to adjust that and already seeing it so that it makes sense with the cost of hand work that is given, it has to be increased by at least 20 pesos. But knowing the flexibility or inflexibility of our market, we would have to wait for a decline in demand of our products and services. This is because we would become even more expensive and for example in a month where In a month where people have little money, like February, this could be difficult for us. So for this we need a complementary strategy where we not only offer the buffet, but also a low-cost producer price that even with 60 or 70 pesos someone can eat. In this way we protect ourselves.

[11/27/25, 5:30 PM] Well, then I'm going to describe what the complementary strategy is to offer tacos, to offer individual tacos from 23 pesos, 22 pesos, this in order to be able to offer prices that can be accessible to more people. In three weeks, here in Morelia, hardly anyone can have the freedom to spend 600 pesos, 1200 pesos. So it is important not to depend on just those six months, seven months that come to consume us in three weeks, which is when we have more problems to sell, to protect ourselves by offering more affordable prices. We already have the staff, we already have everything that is needed, we have the available space and it would not involve more effort. we would only have to protect ourselves from the cannibalization of the products, since some, those who eat a little, for example, could prefer to buy tacos individually instead of buffet and the average of tacos per person will go up if we are not careful If we follow the same strategy where we allow people to order either the basic, the premium, or the taco trio. Usually people who eat little, eat the taco trio, the basic, the ones who eat more or less, and so on. With this strategy, we would change, we would protect ourselves. This is the table. You must choose how you are going to consume. If everyone is going to do, let's say a table of four people arrives, everyone must ask for a prize or all basic or all to the card. We would have to explain in a kind way why this is. First, by welcoming them, being very specific, at least from the moment they arrive, and to avoid, for example, that the person who eats very little asks for one or two tacos, and the people who eat a lot ask for the buffet. So, in this way, we can create, or everyone can order a buffet, even the person who eats little, or everyone can eat individual tacos, which is convenient for both of us. If everyone orders a buffet, we know that even those who eat little will order a buffet, and if everyone is on the menu, we know that the utility margin will be greater. be greater in all, even in the very few.

[11/27/25, 5:32 PM] So, I think that in this way we would be protecting ourselves and later we would have to increase the price of the UFE, But I wouldn't worry so much anymore because we would have a support. This support would be from the people who buy from us, sometimes they spend 70 pesos, 80 pesos, 120 pesos with us. And I think it is a strategy that complements the other very well. to help us especially in three weeks where we have although it gives us six tables although all of them contribute a lot to the expenses if two or three do not come, it practically affects us a lot. And it also becomes a problem of probabilities, since the demand varies a lot and it is difficult for us to maintain, for example, to know how much we occupy. However, if we do it in the majority of the case, it would be easier to predict how much it will take, mainly in three weeks, as we already do on the weekend. By weekend, I mean Saturdays and Sundays.

[11/27/25, 5:49 PM] Now, observing the TikTok strategy, the ROAS are not as high as they were initially. This was to be expected, because due to the low Facebook, the ROAS were initially very high. This is surely because it is not new on the platform, a new audience knows you and you are more accessible to any type of advertising you do. But even so, if we have definitely indicated that there was a general increase in the number of people who visit us, I dare say that currently 40%, 38% already comes from TikTok. And it is definitely an area that we have not exploited to the point where we could do it This Monday I asked an influencer to come and record a couple of videos so that this has been the best strategy, the combination of influencer with videos on TikTok and even on Facebook, is the one that has had the greatest conversion, in our landing page. For much more than the videos I have made with artificial intelligence or photographs, people seem to be very susceptible to others recommending them. in a casual way, or simply see it, see the experience from the perspective of the person who is visiting and not from another perspective. So maybe it would be very necessary to call her again or someone else to explore our new strategy of individual taxes And maybe. Now that I think about it, we could have. I don't remember the specific name, but our marketing strategy, the tax that is the one that pulls, the one that doesn't leave as much profit, but it's the one that I think it's the dog, I don't remember exactly what it's called, but it's the one that pulls. We could include some of our packs that we know cost us 8 pesos, and sell them for 19 pesos. The goal would be to get them with this strategy, with a price of 19 pesos and hopefully I will end up buying one of 20 something or even change them to the library I have to make projections knowing that people usually fill up with two or three tacos, how many we use to assume that in the future half will consume in this way and the other half will be sustainable. If we see it this way, for example, the consumption of individuals, we could stop to prevent certain things that we currently have and generate costs. Since we would move to a model more similar to a taquería. Currently, for example, one of the reasons that I can't change certain ideas is that people came to celebrate their birthday here and I wanted to give them a good experience.

[11/27/25, 5:50 PM] But, because they came, for example, to offer a birthday party, we are forced to offer them a service that is similar to when they came to participate in a birthday party. But with the other service of individual tacos, there was no such commitment. Someone who expects to spend 80 pesos, 90 pesos, does not expect that experience. And well, then the ROAs of TikTok are not as high as I thought. It is time to wait, but they are definitely an excellent alternative. I will say this month is probably the month that we are going to sell total, although this does not mean much in profit.

[11/28/25, 3:21 AM] i have decided to focus on improving the profit of Costa Coral, and reduce the amount of staff. This is to get more per cost of staff. This is better to reduce destress relate dto them and protect us from low months sales.

[11/28/25, 3:21 AM] Currently I have put on hold the idea of exploring B2B business.

[11/28/25, 3:24 AM] Today I had a discussion with Florencia, she argued that she could do her wok seated, while I asked to not do it. She said that in other places this was possible and I said the we don't do that in Costa Coral. The problem is her actitud, I will not be explaining basic stuff, Only requested it

[11/28/25, 3:33 AM] My thinking on why ineedto focus on costa coral, before b2b model is because I need to prove the solution I sell. Be a video service or something else. So a profitable restaurant, will be a proof of what I can do for others. We will be a unique agency that knows the pain of restaurant and also the way to solve them. We will lack moralgroung If we planned to sell something that has worked on us. I have published tiktoks and spend money on ads on TikTok, but a low profit model makes very hard to make a profit because it doesn't scale well even at higher sales like 150,000 of sales a month, So its pointless to focus on TikTok if the return is minimal

[11/28/25, 3:36 AM] The 10 ROAS in TikTok was at first, it has reduced a little bit, I suposse it will continue to reduce becuause at first we focused on new viewers, and now many of them already  know us.

[11/28/25, 3:49 AM] Here are some important facts, ideas. Present state and possible future paths I am considering 

1. Core business: Costa Coral

Concept: Costa Coral – seafood taco buffet in Morelia, located on a busy, low-income street.

Main products now:

Taco Trio – 3 tacos.

Buffet Básico – cheaper buffet tier (no shrimp plates).

Buffet Premium – more variety, includes shrimp plates like Plato Camarones Louisiana and Mojo and special items like Taco Costa Coral.


Mechanics:

All-you-can-eat tacos during open hours (typically ~13:00–18:30).

Rule: 3 tacos at a time per order (not always strictly enforced).

Self-service salad/salsa bar (vegetables, salsas, limón).


Measured behavior:

Average tacos per buffet customer: ≈6.8–7.

Salad bar adds ≈2 MXN per taco in cost.


Customer segments (very important):

1. Destination / social media customers – discover via TikTok/Facebook, often drive or travel specifically for the buffet, higher willingness to pay (600–1000 MXN per table).


2. Local / street pedestrians – pass by daily, low income, typically don’t come in because buffet ticket (199–289) is too high for a random weekday; they are almost absent from current numbers.





---

2. Historical prices & demand

Most relevant price ladders:

Past/current typical:

Trio: 169

Básico: 199 (you later tested 219)

Premium: 269


Proposed / modeled:

Model A ladder: 169 / 229 / 289 (Trio / Básico / Premium).


Mix at 169/199/269 (based on your data & observations):

Trio: 25% of people

Básico: 25%

Premium: 50%



Behavior / perception:

Básico at 199 felt like a strong “hook” price. At 219, demand looked weaker.

Premium at 269 had strong demand because shrimp plates & variety are perceived as a good deal.

You’re worried that Premium at 299 may be too high for enough people to sustain staff & capacity.



---

3. Monthly sales reality (May–Nov 2025)

From your real data (tickets pagados, no cancelados):

Sales per month:

May: 133,173.20 (221 tickets; 546 people; avg ticket 602.59; 2.47 ppl/ticket)

Jun: 120,924.80 (209; 494; 578.59; 2.36)

Jul: 109,546.21 (173; 441; 633.22; 2.55)

Aug: 106,231.01 (173; 434; 614.05; 2.51)

Sep: 85,911.20 (144; 347; 596.61; 2.41)

Oct: 140,144.80 (237; 545; 591.33; 2.30)

Nov (until 24th): 130,039.30 (185; 403; 702.92; 2.18)


You think November will close around 152,000 MXN.


Sales quality bands (your lived experience):

Very low month: ≈80,000 MXN

Common range: 105,000–110,000 MXN

Good month: ≈140,000 MXN

Rare peak: ≈150,000 MXN



---

4. Daily pattern (last 4 months, no Tuesdays)

Average per day (tickets paid & not cancelled):

Mon: 2,459.62; tickets/día 4.41; people 10.29

Tue: 2,366.00 (BUT only 1 Tuesday → outlier)

Wed: 3,012.19; tickets 4.67; people 11.13

Thu: 2,331.46; tickets 4.44; people 10.13

Fri: 3,298.65; tickets 5.53; people 11.88

Sat: 7,171.61; tickets 12.06; people 26.78

Sun: 9,754.18; tickets 13.72; people 35.56


Ignoring Tuesday (you’re closed most Tuesdays):

Weekly (Mon, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun) ≈ 28,027.71 MXN

Monthly (×4.33 weeks) ≈ 121,360 MXN sales.


This 121k/month is your realistic “current pattern” baseline with 6 open days.


---

5. Cost structure – old “heavy” model vs corrected

5.1. Fixed + ads (same in all scenarios)

Approx per month:

Rent: 13,650

Electricity: ~6,000

Water: 400

Gas: 1,000

Internet: 300

Accountant: 1,400

Garbage: ~520

Security: ~4,333

Ads: ~4,000

→ Total fixed + ads ≈ 31,230 MXN/mes


5.2. Staff structures

OLD assumption (5 staff, used in first model)

Flor: 2,400/week

Florencia: 2,000/week

Leslye: 2,050/week

Monse (weekend): 800/week

Yeni (weekend): 700/week


We had:

Staff wages ≈ 34,423.5 MXN/month

Staff food ≈ 2,276.5 MXN/month

→ Total staff ≈ 36,700 MXN/mes


Total overhead:

O_heavy = 36,700 + 31,230 = 67,930 MXN/mes


Later we corrected that Florencia was NOT actually working yet (she was added for a future “open Tuesday” plan). So real heavy structure is:

Corrected heavy (without Florencia)

Real workers: Flor, Leslye, Monse, Yeni (4 people).

Recalculated:

Wages ≈ 25,763.5 MXN/mes

Staff food ≈ 1,821.2 MXN/mes

→ Staff ≈ 27,585 MXN/mes


Overhead now:

O_noF = 27,585 + 31,230 ≈ 58,815 MXN/mes



Slim staff (Model A / lean)

This is your desired lean structure:

Week (baseline slim):

Flor: full week

Florencia: full week

Monse: weekends

You on floor


Monthly staff (incl. food) ≈ 24,000 MXN/mes.

Overhead:

O_slim = 24,000 + 31,230 = 55,230 MXN/mes



We also considered a 4-person slim+ staff (Flor + Florencia + Leslye + Monse):

Staff total ≈ 33,214 MXN/mes

Overhead:

O_4staff = 33,214 + 31,230 ≈ 64,444 MXN/mes




---

6. Reconstructed COGS & margins

Using your CSV + cost-per-taco sheet + invoices:

6.1. Food + salad

Buffet Básico:

Weighted average taco cost (food only): ≈8.51 MXN


Buffet Premium:

Weighted average taco cost (food only): ≈11.37 MXN


Salad bar ≈2 MXN per taco.


With 6.8 tacos per buffet person:

Básico food+salad cost per customer:
(8.51 + 2) × 6.8 ≈ 71.5 MXN

Premium food+salad cost per customer:
(11.37 + 2) × 6.8 ≈ 90.9 MXN


Taco Trio:

COGS per Trio ≈ 51 MXN at price 169 → 30.2% food-only COGS.


At prices 169 / 229 / 289:

Trio: 51 / 169 ≈ 30.2% COGS

Básico: 71.5 / 229 ≈ 31.2% COGS

Premium: 90.9 / 289 ≈ 31.5% COGS


With mix 25/25/50:

Blended food+salad COGS ≈ 31.1% of sales.


6.2. Drinks, tortillas, cheese, extras

Using invoices & your estimates:

Drinks (Coca + agua with refill) ≈ 4.7–4.9% of sales.

Tortillas + cheese + daily pequeñas compras ≈ 1.5–2%.


So:

With free agua for reservations → total COGS ≈ 39% of sales.
→ Gross margin ≈ 61%.

With no free agua promo (agua always paid) → total COGS ≈ 37%.
→ Gross margin ≈ 63%.


These 37–39% COGS numbers are consistent across scenarios.


---

7. Profit formulas by scenario

7.1. “Today” – heavy staff (no Florencia), free agua, 169/219/269

Overhead: O_noF ≈ 58,815.

COGS ≈ 39% → margin ≈ 61%.


Profit:

> Profit_actual(R) = 0.61·R − 58,815



Break-even:

R ≈ 58,815 / 0.61 ≈ 96,400 MXN/mes


Profit at ~121,360 (current 6-day pattern):

Profit ≈ 0.61·121,360 − 58,815 ≈ 14.9k MXN
(earlier we had ~6k when using the 5-staff assumption; corrected model with no Florencia improves that).


Month-by-month with O_noF and 61% margin:

May (133,173) → ≈ 22.4k

Jun (120,925) → ≈ 14.9k

Jul (109,546) → ≈ 8.0k

Aug (106,231) → ≈ 6.0k

Sep (85,911) → ≈ −6.4k

Oct (140,145) → ≈ 26.7k

Nov partial (130,039) → ≈ 20.5k


So: current structure + free agua gives moderate profits in good months, and losses in very low months.

7.2. Slim staff (Model A), no free agua, 169/229/289, full Premium menu

Overhead: O_slim = 55,230.

Total COGS ≈ 37% → margin ≈ 63%.


Profit:

> Profit_A(R) = 0.63·R − 55,230



Break-even:

R_BE ≈ 55,230 / 0.63 ≈ 87,700 MXN/mes


Key points:

At 80k: ≈ −4.8k

105k: ≈ 10.9k

110k: ≈ 14.1k

120k: ≈ 20.4k

130k: ≈ 26.7k

150k: ≈ 39.3k


At your realistic current pattern R ≈ 121,360:

Profit_A ≈ 0.63·121,360 − 55,230 ≈ 21.2k MXN/mes


So just moving to slim staff + 169/229/289 + no free agua converts your typical month into ~21k profit.

7.3. Slim staff, no free agua, 169/219/269 (same prices, only structure + water change)

You also considered:

Keeping prices 169/219/269 initially, but switching to slim staff and removing free agua.


Then:

Overhead: 55,230.

Total COGS ≈ 38% → margin ≈ 62%.


Approx profit:

> Profit_B(R) ≈ 0.62·R − 55,230



At R = 120k:

Profit_B ≈ 0.62·120,000 − 55,230 ≈ 19k+ MXN


This scenario is very gentle on customers (no price increases, only water policy change) but already pushes you near 20k/month profit.

7.4. 4 staff + you, 169/229/289, no free agua

Overhead: O_4staff ≈ 64,444.

Margin ≈ 63%.


Profit:

> Profit_C(R) = 0.63·R − 64,444



At 120k:

Profit_C ≈ 11.2k (worse than slim staff by ~9k at same sales).


So C is dominated by Model A: same customer impact but lower profit.

7.5. 4 staff + you, 169/229/269, no free agua, Premium WITHOUT Louisiana & Costa Coral

This is the “Premium 269 but weaker product” scenario:

Overhead: 64,444.

Removing Louisiana + Costa Coral slightly reduces Premium cost per person but price also drops; net effect: Premium margin% is worse than Básico at 269.

Blended COGS ≈ 38%, margin ≈ 62%.


Profit:

> Profit_269(R) ≈ 0.62·R − 64,444



At R = 152k (your Nov forecast):

289 scenario profit ≈ 31.3k

269-without-Lousiana/Costa scenario ≈ 29.9k


So dropping Premium price and killing flagship dishes lowers profit and hurts perceived value.


---

8. Water (agua con refill) impact

Historically:

Reservations got agua con refill for free.

A large fraction of customers (≈60%) come via reservations.

This makes beverage COGS higher while beverage revenue is lower, pushing total COGS % toward 39–40%.


In scenarios where you remove the free agua promo (everyone pays for agua):

Beverage COGS as % of sales drops.

Total COGS improves from ~39% → ~37%.

Combined with slim staff, this is a major driver of profit improvement without visible “price hikes” on the main buffet products.



---

9. Two customer segments & non–zero-sum insight

You realized an important strategic point:

Current math assumed a zero-sum game (same total R, just slicing between buffet & tacos).

But in reality there are two distinct markets:

1. Destination, social media, higher-ticket buffet crowd.


2. Local low-income pedestrians who virtually never come now.




Per-taco pricing at ~3.3× COGS can:

Create a new revenue stream from locals who only have 60–100 MXN.

Protect you in bad months (e.g., February) when buffet tickets feel too heavy.

Still keep buffet attractive for heavy eaters.


The key is:

> Per-taco is not just another way to charge existing buffet customers; it’s a way to sell to people who currently do not show up at all.




---

10. Per-taco model – numbers

10.1. Safe per-taco pricing

For Básico-type tacos:

COGS (with salad bar) ≈ 9–10.5 MXN.


If you sell them:

At 29 MXN → COGS% ≈ 31–36%; heavy eaters can become less profitable than buffet.

At 33 MXN (3.3×) → COGS% ≈ 28–32%; for a 7-taco eater:

7 × 33 = 231 MXN ≈ Básico buffet @229, so economics are preserved.



For more expensive tacos (shrimp, etc., COGS 15–18 MXN):

Per-taco price band should be ≈ 49–59 MXN to maintain ~30–32% COGS.


10.2. New local taco segment example

Conservative example:

8 new local customers per weekday-like day (Mon, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat).

Each eats 2.5 tacos.

Month has ≈ 21.6 such days.


Then:

New customers: ~173/month.

Tacos sold: ~433/month.

Revenue: 433 × 33 ≈ 14,300 MXN/mes.

COGS: 433 × 10 ≈ 4,330 MXN.

Gross profit from this new segment alone: ≈10k MXN/mes.


This sits on top of buffet; it did not exist before.


---

11. Combined scenarios with per-taco + slim staff

We’ve effectively converged on this target operating model:

Staff:

Weekdays (Mon, Wed, Thu, Fri): 2 in kitchen + you.

Weekend (Sat, Sun): 3 in kitchen + you.

Staff ≈ 24,000 MXN/mes; overhead 55,230.


COGS target: 37% (buffet + tacos), margin 63%.

Buffet prices: target 169 / 229 / 289.

Water: no free agua with reservation.

No mixed tables: either all buffet or all tacos at a table.


Key scenario you just defined:

> “Sell individually to 20 customers on weekdays and 4 on weekend days, on top of existing buffet, with buffet at 229/289.”



Assumptions used:

20 taco customers per weekday (Mon, Wed, Thu, Fri), 4 per day on Sat–Sun.

Week = 4 weekdays + 2 weekend days in this count → 88 taco customers/week.

Month ≈ 4.33 weeks → ≈381 taco customers/month.

Each eats 2.5 tacos → ~953 tacos/month.

Per-taco: price 33, COGS 10.


Then:

Taco revenue: 953 × 33 ≈ 31,436 MXN.

Taco COGS: 953 × 10 ≈ 9,526 MXN.

Taco gross profit: ≈21,900 MXN.


Buffet side:

With 169/229/289 and your current buffet traffic, we estimated buffet sales ≈ 129,143 MXN/mes.

Profit from buffet + slim staff (no tacos): ≈ 26,130 MXN/mes.


Add tacos:

Total revenue: 129,143 + 31,436 ≈ 160,579 MXN/mes.

Profit with margin 63% and overhead 55,230:

0.63 × 160,579 − 55,230 ≈ 45,934 MXN/mes.



So:

> Under slim staff + 169/229/289 + no free agua + tacos to 20 weekday/4 weekend customers, you land around 46k MXN/month profit at ≈160.6k MXN in revenue.



That’s roughly:

3× better than your old ~14–15k profit in May/Oct under heavy staff.

~2× better than the ~21k from buffet-only slim staff.



---

12. Best paths (stepwise strategy)

Step 1 – Structural fix with minimal customer shock

Move to slim staff:

Weekdays: 2 in kitchen + you.

Weekends: 3 in kitchen + you.


Kill free agua with reservation.

Option A (softest): keep prices at 169/219/269 for a short period → Profit ≈ 19k/mes at ~120k sales.

Option B (main target): go to 169/229/289 with full Premium menu → Profit ≈ 21k/mes at 121k, ≈31k at 152k.


This alone makes the business healthy without changing the “product concept.”

Step 2 – Add per-taco line as a separate product for locals

Design per-taco pricing at ≈3.3× COGS:

Básico-type tacos: 33–35 MXN.

Mid-cost: 39–45 MXN.

Shrimp / high-cost: 49–59 MXN.


Enforce:

No mixed tables.

Messaging: buffet = “full experience / probar todo”; tacos = “opción económica / 2–4 tacos”.


Start small:

Offer per-taco only on selected weekdays and time windows (e.g., Wed–Fri, 1–5 pm).

Track:

taco customers/día.

Avg tacos/person.

Avg ticket for tacos.

Signs of cannibalization from buffet vs. new local faces.




Goal: validate that you can attract at least ~8–20 locals per weekday without killing buffet.

Step 3 – Solidify the low-staff, dual-engine model

If data shows:

Per-taco segment adds 10–20k MXN gross monthly.

Buffet traffic remains strong on weekends.

COGS stays around 37% overall.


Then you can lock in:

Staff: 2 weekdays / 3 weekend.

Prices: 169/229/289 for buffet + 3.3× for tacos.

No free agua.


At that point:

A typical 130–160k month under this model yields 30–45k MXN profit.

Low months (e.g., 100–110k) still produce profit instead of loss, thanks to:

Lower fixed overhead.

Extra local taco demand at low tickets.




---

This summary captures:

All core facts (prices, COGS, staff costs, sales levels).

The relationships (how profit depends on R in each scenario).

The scenarios (heavy vs slim, with/without free agua, with/without taco line, 269 vs 289 Premium).

The current state (around 120–130k sales, ~15–20k profit with corrected numbers).

The possible future states:

Slim buffet-only (~21–31k profit depending on sales).

Slim buffet + taco engine (~30–46k profit).


And the best path:

Fix structure & water → add per-taco as a new local funnel → then solidify higher buffet prices once the lower-staff, dual-engine model is working.

[12/2/25, 6:30 PM] For some reason in a note it seems like my profit for November is November, which should provide financial tranquility, yields an estimated profit of only 45,299 MXN. This is not true. If profit is around 17 % of sales with current structure, obviously this is not possible

[12/3/25, 6:12 AM] I didn't implement the idea of videos for other restaurants because of the idea to coordinate other people to do the videos. Will be the same as the restaurant. The problems with dealing with staff is awful in Mexico. Too many variables. At least the restaurant is working

[12/3/25, 6:25 AM] I have modeled many scenarios using AI on what could I do with Costa Coral and the possible outcomes. Given that a $30,000 mxn to $40,000 mxn is possible doing some changes. Makes me want to focus on costa coral. For reference my rent of my house is $7000 mxn. Now the question is, would costumers accept those changes? I don't know but is probable. To the point that I will implement one by one in the following weeks. I like Costa Coral and the idea of a restaurant, when I remove the pressure of making payments and surviving, the idea of optimization and experimentation is something I like. No need for a B2B. The problem is with high problems an no money

[12/4/25, 5:31 AM] Florencia no longer work with us. I fired her on Sunday.

[12/4/25, 5:32 AM] This week we are going to remove one table to attend better our costumers. Because 8 tables can be served well with 2 servers but 10 we need one more.

[12/4/25, 5:35 AM] It's 11:34pm. I'm on the computer playing with AI, I sleep around 1 hour when I arrived from work.

[12/4/25, 6:28 AM] I am scared of dropping demand if I increase prices in the buffet. This is way I want to wait until I first advertise prices of single tacos and have some kind of demand so if the prices drop they don't affect me too much. But for another part is a must we need to in increase prices because the prices of isnumos have rised in the last months, not by much but that is a reason and the main one is that I am making so little money for such an effort

[12/4/25, 7:45 PM] Okay, let's see if this records audio well. I'm going to take advantage of the moments where I'm working in the restaurant to document my plan. I want to say that in the moments that I have the freedom, I will clearly know what I want to say, and not to be slowly losing time in these places.

[12/4/25, 7:47 PM] Here in the restaurant we have two ads for the customers that are passing by. One of them talks about our TACO TRIO that costs 169 pesos and the other is from our buffet and it is handled at 253 pesos. that in reality right now costs 190,000 pesos. I realize that it is striking, so this is an opportunity area that we have to improve, since I notice that the people who buy from us are very limited in the number of people who pass by on the street. But I feel that it is because they bring little money in their pockets. and it is difficult for them to spend 169 or 200 pesos, but it would be much easier for them to spend 60 or 70 pesos. For this reason, it is necessary that we start selling individual products at an affordable price so that the barrier is not too big. And we hope that we can sell them something a little higher, from the water, a more expensive taco. And this contributes to our client base, which is not only the one we can bring through social networks, but also the one that passes and increases our profits.

[12/4/25, 8:44 PM] I have felt a sudden drop on my energy. Don't know if it's a lack of rest, stress or the respiratory infection I got a few weeks ago (most probable) one thing is for sure. I need to eat better, have less sugar in my diet, more veggies and some exercise apart from the one I do at work when walking. I have seen that dropping eating sugar increment my energy.

[12/5/25, 3:37 AM] Ok, it's time to talk. Right now it's 9.35, I'm thinking about whether to eat or not. The truth is that I'm not very hungry and I wouldn't mind not eating, I'll lose a few kilos. It does not sound true, well, in fact, if I do not have something that is not very healthy, I will surely buy something. Right now it does not sound bad the idea of ​​sleeping early, and that would guarantee me to wake up early and not start the day doing something and not start the day already in a hurry. I noticed it when I arrived in Costa Coral early I had time to do more not be in the race and although at the end of the day we had few clients, in reality I have not invested enough in advertising these days We really need a day, maybe free, to regroup and take at least some photos and make some calculations. For example, I took the opportunity to have the new prices for the individual tacos. and this well, it's fine the other days have not been bad in sales, they have been acceptable and I already have a video, a couple of videos to publish on TikTok thanks to to that I hired an influencer who supported me in that this, that's it

[12/5/25, 3:40 AM] I don't know why I'm relaxed when there are many things to do, maybe because the sales have not been bad at costo cobrado and also because I said goodbye to Florencia and well, it was a expense that worried me since I had to force myself to sell more and if not, because if not, I could get into trouble now the boat is lighter without it and obviously I have to optimize our sales, look for a greater margin of gain so that this to have a more acceptable income, then every day that passes is more convinced of the change I have to make within the Coral Coast and that will lead to me having more tranquility but it is also clear to me that being there full time does not allow me to explore other things that I would like to do at this time with all that has been presented of artificial intelligence I would like to be more involved and well currently I cannot do it since I have to be working in Costa Coral however I would like to have the financial capacity and the time to explore with these tools create with these artificial intelligence tools to create tools for me and for others. There is still, for example, all the needs that restaurants have and since they are not covered and can be done with artificial intelligence, maybe there is an opportunity, but my time is very limited and many times I get tired of the house after having been for a long time, well, stopped at the restaurant, maybe I don't know, I want to, I would like to explore what I can do with artificial intelligence, to be able to get money from there and use this tool not to stay behind as many times it has happened to me that I discover something and soon others surpass me since they get more involved in time the time they dedicate to it then I with the little time I have available I use it to be with artificial intelligence, explore, see what can be done. I am interested in knowing the news about artificial intelligence, but if it is not the time I want, the time I want.

[12/5/25, 3:07 PM] Yesterday I went to bed early. Happy for myself. The goal was to be not as pressured today in the morning.and while I didn't wake up at the hour I wanted. I feel like I rest well.

[12/5/25, 5:08 PM] Well, some clarifications. Currently, as I have said in other notes, in three weeks we will only meet, Leslie, Flor and me, and at the end of the week, Jenny and Monser will join. and indeed I have already felt a little more calm because our costs have been significantly reduced. So I know that a bad week is not going to represent a loss. It is more likely that we will find ourselves with a desire, although it is limited, but it will be something more relaxed. We will have to postpone the increase of the full staff until we achieve both making the model more profitable and making our demand more predictable and be able to increase it. So, I will have to go to work as a waiter. Although it is a bit tiring, I think I have to accept it and I want it to work. At this stage, this is what I have to do.

[12/5/25, 5:10 PM] The decision to record my personal and work notes, thoughts and actions, is because previously I realized that I made the same mistakes over and over again. This affected me a lot, for example, I was very impulsive, doing impulsive purchases, where I expected that they would give me a financial result, but many times it didn't happen and I was already indebted. This, among other things, many things that I have decided not to comment on, this through an introspection of everything I do. I think it has worked quite well. It doesn't take me much time, especially because I use it with voice-to-text technology. I do it when I'm walking, etc. I think it's a good tool.

[12/5/25, 5:21 PM] I want to clarify something. Right now, with the staff that we are going to operate with, it is with Leslie and Flor in three weeks, and at the end of the week, Leslie, Flor, Jenny and Monzo. I decided to do this because there is a high probability that at the end of the week the sales will be high enough to justify this amount of staff. I will continue to participate every day, with the exception of Tuesdays, which we do not open. We can stop mentioning Slim Staff because we can no longer reduce it so much without for example possibly getting into problems that on weekends we cannot attend to the flow of customers that we will very likely have. I would say that there is an 80% chance that we will sell between 9,000 pesos a 11,000 pesos actualmente y para esto si se requiere por lo pronto tres personas en cocina y dos personas en piso que son que somos los que vemos si lo redujera este staff me arriesgo a dar a bad service which we cannot do since precisely the people is what those who have qualified us very well in the speed in the flavor in the in service I don want to compromise simply by saving saving 600, 700 pesos, 800 pesos on a weekend to give a bad service. Even so, we are very limited, since on the day that one of the staff gets sick, we risk giving a very bad service. but that's what the finances allow us right now. It is necessary to increase the price of the buffets, but at the same time, to make known our offer of individual tacos, so that those who do not have that capacity to spend 200 pesos 300 pesos 600 pesos in the buffet can spend 80 pesos, 90 pesos, any other day. I have stopped mainly for two things, being a waiter, cleaning, I know that these are low-value activities, but right now I can't afford that someone else does them, because it prevents me from being at home on the computer doing those tasks. And when I get home, many times I get very tired and what I least want is to keep working. I think about a week ago I already felt the burnout, which I must be very careful because that affects all parts of the business.

[12/5/25, 5:25 PM] Flor also told me yesterday that she is worried about being very far from her son, that she sees him as if he were a bad mother. And I understand her, she has to work here for practically eight hours. in Costa Coral, and it takes, let's say, 50 minutes to move from there and 50 to return. So this makes her live very little with her son, she is tired, plus other problems she has. So that makes me think, because she is my most working woman, the one who has worked the most, the one who has... I can say that Costa Coral would not exist without her effort. So we must make Costa Coral a very functional place, for example, in her case, to reduce her working day, and she can spend more time with her son. I think we are smart enough to achieve this. But to achieve this we have to make the cost of the coral more profitable I would like to analyze the numbers to see how much how much we are I don know how to calculate it but yes, that is a fact that the time that they are in the coral coast generates very little money, regardless if it is because we have few people or because or maybe very few clients we force them to pay our expenses are divided by very few people so I also wonder what would happen if we increased our customer base and this is done with individual funds so that the weight of our expenses and our earnings is not distributed among so few clients who are the ones who go to our buffet on the weekend because we have already reached a peak in capacity both in the kitchen and it cannot serve more people and the people who fit into the current space, well, it is also 100% already, let's say, some Sundays. So we can no longer ask for more on the weekend, but if on the weekend, sorry, but if on the three days of the week, where we have very few people. And that's it.

[12/5/25, 5:36 PM] I am clear about the actions I have to make. Maybe I have to have a plan to choose first to make the strategy be the right one. What has happened to me previously? than a price rise and a drop in demand, even if this drop has nothing to do with the price rise but with a matter of the season it generates stress for me So I want to avoid that a little bit as much as possible. But yes, as I read, I can't afford to reason. and get that information, but in a certain way I must pay to obtain that information. In this case, paying, taking the action of increasing the prices, it can be a controlled experiment or already definitively, and see the response of the clients. If we follow the law of supply and demand, Well now at the weekend I could say that we have more people than we can serve at least on some Sundays it has been fulfilled in the last three weeks so it would justify an increase so that those who are willing to pay this increase receive the service and not have to wait at the door or that we give them a bad service because we are serving people who will only leave us a smaller amount than what our service is worth. But I also know that if I do that, if we currently have a limited demand in three weeks, it may be reduced even more. So I must cover that possibility. This is advertising and making the growth of individual tacos in three weeks. We have already seen that people consume our tacos for example from Arrachera the people of the area as long as we give them at an affordable price So, yes, I have to do both things. And we have to take advantage of the fact that we are in December and that people are willing to spend. Here in Mexico there is a phenomenon called the cost of money, which is due to the fact that all the people are spent for Christmas, the gifts to the children of the Magi and other expenses. People are very busy. And in January and mainly February, they don't have much money. So last year we saw a drop in our sales in mid-February. So we prepared for that month.

[12/6/25, 7:00 AM] Because I am in a town with "no industry" where "many people gravitate to start a food place". Because there are so many options, the customer has all the power. If you don't take the risk (by lowering prices or offering better food), they go next door.

[12/9/25, 6:16 AM] Ok, I feel a certain resistance to raise the price of our Buffet. In my mind there are many activities that have to be done to raise the price, but it is obvious to me that it is currently not sustainable to have the buffet at this price. So, it is necessary to make the price changes so that it is more sustainable. I imagine that I have to do many activities and, simply, if I think about it, I would have to change I would have to print a small menu with the number of tacos the price although this is a temporary solution to print about 10 and from the buffet menu simply print another 10 to do the test on Wednesday in addition to removing the advertising with the previous price and put the new one even if it is little and update the pressure on the digital menu that is very easy and if I mention it that way it is not so difficult even if I wanted to make it easier easier I would only have to print 10 minus 12 minus with the new price and change the digital menu that I know as I said it is easy and also of the advertising only put perhaps two ads with the new price or without price and this only so that there are no traces left that we were selling it at another price and that way I could have it for Wednesday and the individual tacos can be integrated into what goes on in the week to make it easier and already advancing in the increase in the price

[12/9/25, 8:42 PM] I feel a little anxious, I don't know exactly the reason, or a little worried. This is because of the payments that have to be made for the coral coast of our suppliers, Pays that are made annually by the workers. We barely made it to the cost of labor. and well, I think that's what makes me feel anxious, not being sure if we're going to be able to make those payments. This concern is constant. We need a greater margin. But now my question is... an increase in the price will fix it, really if we are going to generate in theory a little more income, this is only if the clients who usually come to Costa Coral continue to go, the demand does not decline and that generates anxiety worry but it is also a reality that right now the fatigue that Costa Coral generates is already generating fatigue in me beyond what Well, a sustained fatigue. After several days I decided that we were going to rest for two days, that is, we would close one day and we would put it together with our regular Tuesday rest to be able to have a little more rest. And well, yes, it served me and I hope it will also equip me. I already started the tasks to change the price, so I don't stop worrying that people see it as a high price and stop going to consume. But I suppose I should find out if this is true. And yes, it will generate a little anxiety in these days if the demand falls. But I guess it is necessary. Now what I can do is make the increase. in the menu, I think that connecting the menu and removing the official references from the previous press and it would already be on the other side.

[12/9/25, 10:02 PM] I would like to have more, remember more the idea of imperfect solutions, this is that many times I get paralyzed because I want to create the perfect solution and I end up postponing The solution, because the perfect solution requires a lot of information, and that information, obviously with an imperfect solution, you can obtain it faster and you can iterate faster. However, when you want everything to be perfect before implementing a solution, an idea, you simply postpone and you are trying to think too much that the point that you simply postpone, however, sometimes an imperfect solution causes you to be more sure of what you want since you start to feed yourself with information immediately, in addition to the fact that you can implement something very basic with low costs, then, well, I think I would like to be constantly reminded of how good an imperfect solution has since I think I procrastinate a lot when I want to implement perfect solutions.

[12/10/25, 3:36 AM] I think I feel confused. This is because I am about to make the decision that artificial intelligence gave me, which is simply to increase my prices. Artificial intelligence advises me that not increasing them is a sign of cowardice. And that I must seek my tranquility over the rejection of a stranger. But is artificial intelligence really right Has has explored all the possibilities I'm coming to the conclusion, or rather, I just had an insight, that maybe it proves that intelligence is only managing the possibilities that I manage, let's say that I put the options and it gives me one of them, selects one of those options, but the reality is that there may be other alternatives that he has not considered and I have not considered that they can be better for the business. I do not know if this is I hope I'm right, but right now in my mind I'm seeing it this way. Currently, a taco, let's analyze it only in a taco, from Costa Coral, is a combination, well not a taco a client a client that we serve is a combination of several tacos that take time to make each of those tacos let's say a client, we have clients who eat 10 tacos, so it is expensive what we give them and it is also expensive in terms of gas, in terms of staff time to prepare those 10 tacos that he receives. It is also expensive for the one who prepares it and the one who serves it, takes those 10 tacos. And if we only increase the price, we will continue with that paradigm, we can say, that we create we solve the problem of the customer that he is dissatisfied giving them something expensive to produce and at the same time and also expensive to serve to prepare but what happens if the simplistic solution of increasing prices is not the correct one we will continue trapped in that In this product that is difficult to create, what happens if the individual tacos are not like the ones we currently make, but they are big tacos. In reality, we are going to give them more product, but at the same time it will be easier to do it, it will be faster, it will require, in theory, less people. It will scale better when we talk about staff. Why will the client fill in less?

[12/10/25, 3:45 AM] I want to continue trying to solve this problem because in the end, maybe it is convenient for us when we sell individual tacos, to create tacos that obviously have a much greater value, In this way, it will be easier for the staff to serve that client in less time. Since instead of having 3 or 4 tacos to fill, we will have the same profit with 1 taco, even with 2. In fact, that could be the idea, to think that those tacos have to be so big that with a single taco it will fill the crowd. In this way we would cover both a problem that we have seen that the patients then see that the tattoos are very poor. As for the protein we would clearly do them in such a way that they were abundant but in the same way it would not be difficult for us to collect what is really worth it We could even give them with double tortilla so that if they want to make two tacos. because we, the staff, since he only had to use the fryer once or it takes him at the same time, I don't know, to heat four shrimp instead of eight at the same time, he no longer had to repeat that same activity twice because with the idea of ​​small tacos, the problem is that Well, we would take it and later on the client would want other tacos and so on. We do not have to worry about the acceptance of those tacos, new individual tacos, large ones that will not be cheap because we are anchored to something that, let's say, in a certain way, currently works, which is the buffet and that at least pays us the bills. So I would like to explore how feasible this idea of making large tacos is. I also think that this would draw a lot of attention on social networks. Not to publish the price, because they are really going to make not so cheap tacos, and look for a combination that works.

[12/10/25, 3:48 AM] Let's do a mental exercise. We have tacos that cost less than 10 pesos, but for a simple example, let's suppose they cost 10 pesos. And they are tacos that people eat, that they consume inside the buffet. But what happens if we return them for $15? That additional cost of $5 makes the taco look very abundant. and we would have to give it, if we multiply it, to get a profit of around 45 pesos. But that was a taco that we would consider profitable It would not only be profitable, but it would look good. And we would be happy to serve it. Because we would know that with this taco, people would be full and this one also this one could even be two tacos from there and then the profit of that taco would be 30 pesos, which would not be profit, it would be gross profit, which would not be bad. For a quick job to do.

[12/10/25, 6:37 AM] I kind of feel guilty of raising prices. Don't know why. Trying to justify the rising. But I feel guilty. Maybe the idea that I dont know what I am doing. That we don't deserve it

[12/10/25, 10:34 PM] the average ticker per person in november 2025 was 284 mxn per person. per table it was 574 mxn per table. we served 241 tables and a total of 498 people were served. This is data extracted directly from the POS software. So its a fact.

[12/10/25, 11:05 PM] Flor has helped me to define 6 options for the tacos individuales. The idea behind this strategy is to offer very good a la carte alternatives that go well with our seafood, relaxed place to eat. The will be not cheap, targeting a cost from 40 to 90 mxn each. The idea is find a more scalable and more profitable alternative to the buffet. I think is very costly in staff to run a buffet and only works in a volume. and while I think we eventually reach that volume. currenlty it leave us in a very risky situation having to have staff for low days. 

So while the buffet is running, we will also be offering this delicious options as a la carte. We already have the instalations, the staff. we will put each model to the test agains each other, trying to find which one is the most profitable one

[12/10/25, 11:09 PM] I dont fear a carreer as a software developer. In fact I think I have a fair chance. With AI I have already made the software to make reservations here in costa coral. our digital menu, made several web apps for myself. For example one to mix video clips to create TikToks. And so on.

[12/11/25, 12:03 AM] The price has been increased. Tomorrow we start with the new price

[12/11/25, 12:44 AM] I feel strangely calm, despite the fact that I have to make several payments to suppliers, I have to give the workers a hand, and it is clear to me that right now I do not have that money. I say strangely because, although I should be more anxious, I am not. I know I can't solve anything with anxiety. And I just have to go solving little by little. As I said before, we are going to increase the prices tomorrow, which will be interesting. I'm curious to see how people perceive it. We will surely put the qualifications in our survey, to see how much they are worth. and well, I am convinced that I can not continue to give away my work, I do think that we are giving enough value and well, I think I have to start valuing, if not I will value your work And I am satisfied with that decision, regardless of the result.

[12/11/25, 12:45 AM] I would like to be more productive. Today I woke up very late, I woke up at 10 in the morning. and I started to get late to work, I was a little stressed because I did not see the service as a waiter that the first customers deserved, and although everything worked, there is no need, the mistake was simply not having set the alarm, and one morning I said, yes, of course, I will sleep a little earlier, I didn't do it because it was on my cell phone. I wasn't even doing something very productive. Well, I don't know if it was productive or not, but I was asking the artificial intelligence using my notes. Well, in reality, some of the words he told me made me feel committed to increasing the price.

[12/11/25, 9:16 PM] first sale after new pricing 229/289. A couple of friends. They choose the Taco Trio.

[12/11/25, 9:40 PM] Second table, lets see what they choose. Too son to tell, but maybe the taco trio is a great option. Fast to make and the margin is good. With a buffet costing more (the real value of it), many probably will change to taco trio. The second table today choose basico

[12/11/25, 11:33 PM] With the price change, definetily I saw a move towards Taco Trio. Which is not bad. is almost the profit of the buffet basico when it cost 199 but only half of the effort by the staff. Now that I am not subsidicing the buffet giving it at a low price the real cost shows that maybe many will not buy it. 

Time to adevertise the Taco Trio more. better value for the costumer. and at the better entry point. 

Now I wonder what it will be to be half tired of what I have been for the past months and the same for my team. interesting. 

I am recording this only as a data keeping. Not necessarily because I am worried. I know that writing is thinking and this is what I am doing, while I am attending tables. Fun times. 

Another interesting though. What would happen if only Flor and I worked on weekdays. We could do it if only we prepared taco trios. Becuase they are very easy to compared to buffet where the average is the double of effort and if a couple of heavy eaters arrive they can mess with the times and that is why you need at least 3 people to deliver on time. 

With a la carte I believe is more easy to predict the demand.

[12/12/25, 8:26 PM] well another day with the new prices. Two tables at this hour, one bough 3 buffet basicos at 229 (regular costumers and they even talk to me, saying that the price hike was fine). The other table is 4 woman all biugh premium. This makes me feel good. Still dont know the impact per month. but maybe it shows that a lot of fear. 

For some reason I feel a better relation of effort and value capture per costumer.

[12/12/25, 9:27 PM] yesterday, even as I knew that going to sleep late is awful for me, I went very late (3am). I fact I was very aware of what the AI says to me about going late to bed, that affects all my day. But I did it anyway fixeted to the phone watching short videos. Maybe I should have avoided them all togheter.

[12/13/25, 4:40 PM] Well, I feel satisfied and calm. Yesterday I took the opportunity to create videos of Coral Coast for TikTok and Facebook. I don't know if these videos will be translated into sales, but this was not going to happen if the videos did not exist, so... It's better that they exist. Ah, that they don't exist. And well, I'm already eliminating the traces that were left of the previous price. and well, we already have this videos with the new price to see what to see how it goes the first two days of the people going I see how if many people went for the Well, not much, but most of them. Which is not bad, it is the same profit that the basic buffet left, but only with half of the workload. And only, probably, they are smaller accounts, but it's fine. We will see in the future how this translates to profit, I hope so.

[12/13/25, 5:02 PM] It's Saturday and I'm going to take the opportunity to see if I can make another video to upload to social networks and waiting for this to translate at least one more month in sales. I am also thinking of buying another card payment terminal because the one we currently have takes us a week for that money to be deposited and sometimes it costs me work to finance so that we can not dispose of that money until within a week, so with this other we will have a backup and in addition to the sales of Saturday and Sunday we could arrange the same Monday to make the necessary payments

[12/13/25, 5:23 PM] Maybe I shouldn't record this in my notes, since it's something very... very... temporary. But I'm still going to do it, who knows, maybe there's something important about it. Today, well... Let's see, let's analyze what is the most relevant thing of the day. this the flower goes to his concert so he goes to work at 5 this I have to decide if I buy or not the terminal for for process the payments faster so that money is faster in our account and have it faster. And this... What else? I have to edit the digital menu to eliminate the individual obstacles, since we are not done I don know what recipes are going to be left I think that it for next week Now I going to leave the taco trio It's 11.22 and from what I saw, I think we have no reservation for today. If we judge by how the week has come, it will be relatively weak. But let's hope it doesn't happen anyway. We have to continue. I can't let a week of uncertainty affect me. taking into account that we only sold 170,000 pesos last month, a number that seems incredible, if we compare it with the other restaurant that we had, where the expenses were very high, and we sold 170,000 pesos, or more, but with much greater effort and expenses. which if he never did a viable business and well here we already have a great opportunity, we just have to continue improving.

[12/13/25, 10:06 PM] Ok, I find myself strangely calm. This is the first weekend since we raised the price. On Saturdays, it is extremely low. I would dare to say that it is even lower than... Even if it were today, a Monday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, it would be low. So, the more a Saturday... A Saturday usually ends between 7,000 and... It had ended last month at 11,000. 12,000 pesos, we have been here since 2007, at 4 pm. First impressions, most of them have not asked for the buffet, the premium is only one table. who asked for the prize because the boss paid for it. So I feel that it is too soon to say, I'm just making assumptions, but don't worry. maybe it is not necessarily that it is not worth the price, but the fact that we are a taco buffet, people associate tacos with something cheaper and maybe 199 if it seems like something a pleasure that the family can give on the weekend, due to the matter of mental, which seems a little that you are going to spend, on the other hand, a figure above 200, it seems to be easier to make the that you are going to spend a lot of money. But well, we have to do the experiment capable of throwing ourselves another six months fighting and we do not know what the reason is, we do not know that people would have accepted the price more. we still don't know we need to get more information this one I also think that this makes it easier for me to decide to take some actions that I had thought about before but I refused because I wanted to offer a very good product this is to include the most expensive tacos within the premium buffet like the Camarón Roca, the Camarones Luisiana and the Costa Coral. Seeing that people are not willing to spend what it really costs with these ingredients, I read that you never believe in value, that people are not willing to pay. It makes it very easy for me to remove them. because people are not willing to pay. And well, it is part of the experiment.

[12/13/25, 10:08 PM] I went to other businesses with the hope that maybe we are all the same, but apparently we are the same. There is also another variable to consider, which is in these past days, I did not invest enough in ads. Yes, maybe that also had an effect, but it is very strange to me that we have to spend consistently to have an income. Our customer purchase has to be constant. But well, it has to be like that.

[12/13/25, 10:18 PM] I can see that a little more people have arrived, not the one we occupy, but at least to not go so far. We still have to see the final numbers and analyze them to see what our steps are to follow. we have been considering as I already mentioned here before, that if people are not willing to pay the premium buffet that we currently have, we must reconfigure it to create a more where and present it also in a way that people do not see the cost so high maybe only add the amount of difference between the premium buffet and the basic one so for 49 pesos to the most large the buffet or make it premium In this way it becomes easier to do the math and perhaps more likely to accept changing to the most profitable version for us. And that would have to be done with a design in the menu. we would not have to reconfigure anything but we just have to adapt to have a more profitable business and well, it is not very early to say but it is possible that people are already voting with their and indicate to us what the top is. And this time it is simply a process of understanding more and more and knowing how to rebuild it to get the greatest amount of money, of the value that we believe.

[12/14/25, 2:21 AM] I am satisfied. Today is the first Saturday after we raised the prices to $229 the basic and $289 the premium. And we sold, if I'm not mistaken, 8,600, which is very healthy. I'm going to confirm that number right now, but it's around 8,000 and something. We do feel the day lighter. Maybe it's just confirmation bias, but I mean effort. As more people decided on the most economical options, well, maybe the profit is not so marked, well, the total sale, but I feel less physical activity, I feel less tired. Good data point.

[12/14/25, 2:21 AM] Total sales on Saturday, or today, 8,865.

[12/14/25, 4:37 AM] i should mention that I bough the second card terminal. So we can access our money faster. that was today and it cost 1000 mxn

[12/15/25, 1:09 AM] today we sold 12051.00 mxn, we the new pricing. The load for the staff and me not hard.

[12/15/25, 4:23 AM] I am surprised that even knowing all the time that I can lose in front of the cell phone, watching, I don't know, Instagram, TikTok, even so I do it, I can waste a lot of time on these platforms, which prevents me from even relaxing and watching a movie and eating something, something else that maybe will remember a little better these platforms I have known that they are very addictive and well they make the brain have I become addicted to immediate rewards and nevertheless I keep doing them. I would like to remove that waste of time, that I waste a lot of time on those networks.

[12/15/25, 6:15 AM] this is some basic projection with the new priciing: 


Staff: Flor + Leslye + Monse + Yeni (no Florencia), plus you on floor.

Costs: same fixed + ads as now.

Buffet prices: 169 / 229 / 289 (Trio / Básico / Premium).

Water: assume you keep the same policy as today (free agua with reservation), so total COGS stays about the same fraction of sales.

From all the reconstruction we did:

Total COGS ≈ 39% of sales → gross margin ≈ 61%.

Monthly staff cost (these 4) ≈ 27,585 MXN (wages + staff food).

Fixed + ads ≈ 31,230 MXN.

So overhead = 58,815 MXN/mes.

So the profit formula in this scenario is:

Profit
(
𝑅
)
=
0.61
⋅
𝑅
−
58,815
Profit(R)=0.61⋅R−58,815

where R is total monthly sales.

Profit at different monthly sales (MXN)

Using that formula:

R = 80,000 → Profit ≈ −10,015

R = 90,000 → Profit ≈ −3,915

R = 100,000 → Profit ≈ +2,185

R = 110,000 → Profit ≈ +8,285

R = 120,000 → Profit ≈ +14,385

R = 130,000 → Profit ≈ +20,485

R = 140,000 → Profit ≈ +26,585

R = 150,000 → Profit ≈ +32,685

R = 160,000 → Profit ≈ +38,785

Break-even:

0.61
𝑅
=
58,815
⇒
𝑅
≈
96,400
 MXN/mes
0.61R=58,815⇒R≈96,400 MXN/mes

So with Flor + Leslye + Monse + Yeni, same water policy, and buffet at 169/229/289, you:

Start to make money at around 96k/month in sales.

At something like your current 120–130k pattern, profit sits in the 14–20k/month range under this configuration.

[12/15/25, 8:19 PM] first weekend with new pricing shows (

taco trio	24	24%
basico	16	16%
premium	45	45%


)  this is from friday, saturday and sunday

[12/15/25, 9:27 PM] lets talk about staying wake up at night for random stuff like watching short form videos on the phone. But sometimes is also navigating in X.com in the computer, youtube, or some random stuff. 

while the problem in front of the pc is not as problematic, it can contreubute to the issue of consuming short video content on the phone. its what usually push me from 1am to 3am sleep times. 

even spending time using platforms like chatgpt at night some times produce ideas and not necessarily regreat, aloguht I know that I could have done early so I can go to sleep early.

[12/15/25, 10:43 PM] one thing I need to  work on is my energy which it has been very low latelly. While causes of this low energy could be my eating habits, low excersice amount, sickness. The reality is that i could be doing some stugg to at least not make the problem worse. I suppose drinking more water, going to bed early, no alcohol, eat veggies, etc.

[12/23/25, 4:15 AM] Leslye no longer works with us, considering what to do next. I mean hire someone else or wait. January is one of the slowest months of the year in sales.

[12/23/25, 1:25 PM] Today I woke up at 7:20 am. Planning on taking a coffee while doing some work at my computer. That will be fun and train my mind that waking early have it's perks

[12/23/25, 5:00 PM] I feel strangely calm again. And well, I don't know exactly why. Well, apparently I do know why. But it's strange because this weekend sales were low. If I remember correctly, on Saturday only 5,000. No, sorry, I think it was 5,000. And on Sunday 6,000, which is very low. And I think that would have to do with anxiety. Well, Leslie has already decided to work with us and we are approaching a month that, according to the patterns, is a low month. However, I feel calm because with the exit of Lesley and previously with the exit of Florencia, our weekly expenses are reduced. With the exception of Leslie's departure, I have the option to select if I want someone else to pay it in the month of January or I wait until February Also, maybe by forcing ourselves in January to work in three weeks only, we find the time. more efficient and so there would be more money left in the curtains and this one and I could also increase the salary there we would have a more efficient business where I have more profit and this could be better for both parties. Obviously it would require a greater effort since we would have to redesign several parts, but not the impossible. we managed to sell 3,000 pesos. And the consensus of the people was that the service was fast. So I don't see why it wouldn't be impossible with our adjustments to sell up to 4,000. That's right, you have to be careful so that Flor doesn't have burnout. But I think that if we both think about the money that we will be leaving in extra, I think it would compensate for it.

[12/24/25, 6:12 PM] The decision has been made. Not hire a replacement for Leslye until the last week of January. This will reduce our costs in one of tthe slowest month of the year. We will use the time to try to have a more efficient restaurant, testing ideas to make the kitchen almost work with one person on weekdays. The person in the floor can help. Other ideas like having tablets for clients to order directly to the kitchen or asking stuff like the bill. Could be done with the use of tables, minimizing the time the server needs to be outside and help morewhere is needed (kitchen)

[12/24/25, 6:45 PM] When I mentioned the idea of creating the service so that customers can order with a tablet, I meant to take care of making that system and also take care of serving tables, I mean, to develop the system while I'm in my free time and at the time of being in Costa Coral I would dedicate myself to both serving tables and to be in this case a fryer and preparing the foods that I will have to do double function, not one thing instead of the other
